A number of community members have suggested that we should adjust reward weight (currently 2x) for the SUSHI-ETH LP Pool. What should the weight be?

SUSHI-ETH LP stakers are the ones with highest skin in the game. They are providing liquidity to $SUSHI token and should be rewarded properly. They are also most likely the first pool to migrate from Uniswap to SushiSwap. Increasing the weights incentivizes people to stay in the pool for long run.

Increasing the value too high will naturally make rewards on other LP pools lower (because the total number of $SUSHI minted is limited). This is not good because liquidity and trading volumes are what matters for SushiSwap and $SUSHI tokens in long run.

Once the vote is done, Chef Nomi will take the weighted average value and implement the change by invoking MasterChef ""set"" function through the Timelock contract.

USDT-ETH pool commands by far the highest trading volume on Uniswap , historically sometimes over 50% (see https://uniswap.info/pairs). They naturally have very high liquidity and that currently makes $SUSHI reward yield very low compared to other pools that do not command the same level of liquidity (see https://sushi.zippo.io/). Should we adjust the reward weights of USDT-ETH LP Pool to what value?

It's very important for SushiSwap to compensate them reasonably. We need them to stay with us throughout and after the migration.

**It's important to keep in mind that higher reward for one pool barely affects the rewards of other pools. Do the math.**

I propose migrating the ETH/SUSHI pool earlier than before, with a snapshot prior to and following migration to confirm who stayed providing liquidity during the active migration. As a result, those who continued to provide liquidity to the ETH/SUSHI pair during migration, should receive a one-time ""airdrop"" of bonus SUSHI rewards paid from the dev fund.

Unlike recent forks, Sushiswap employs its own contracts, which means the risk of smart contract bugs are higher than protocols that simply fork other project's code.

To ensure long term survival of the Sushiswap platform and incentivize user loyalty, I propose a small percentage of the dev pool be used to incentivize $SUSHI holders to provide coverage for Sushi contracts on Nexus Mutual.

Insurance products in DeFi are highly underexplored. Currently, Nexus Mutual is the only platform that supports the flexible coverage Sushi requires. In case of a smart contract bug that traps user funds, users who purchased cover on Nexus Mutual can be protected.

Benefits:

Benefit to liquidity providers: can insure against potential smart contract failure and loss of funds

Benefit to users: signals developer confidence in contract security

Benefit to developers: attract more demand for SUSHI as Sushiswap becomes a safer product.

Economics:

The development pool allocation currently sits at 10% of all inflation. A 10% cut of that means 1% of all inflation will be used to incentivize Nexus Mutual stakers.

During the initial 10x bonus period (first two weeks since master chef contract goes live), 1000 SUSHI will be minted per block. After the first two weeks, 100 SUSHI will be minted per block.

Assuming the price of $7/SUSHI and 10% of dev pool (1% of all inflation) is used to incentivize Nexus stakers, this implies roughly $7M first month, or $21M in SUSHI rewards. Currently there is roughly $22M staked for Uniswap contracts on Nexus; assuming conservatively that Sushi covers will be similar to Uniswap, this implies ~100% APY for those who provide insurance coverage for SUSHI.

Alternatively, we can also explore using 5% of dev pool only, which will still result in a 50% APY for Nexus stakers.

Solana is a fast blockchain -- probably the fastest.  It can support over 50k tps without sharding, and costs about $0.00002 per transaction.

Serum is an on-chain DeFi ecosystem built on Solana.  The first core piece of it, an on-chain DEX, went live last week.

Notes: This is submitted on behalf of EcoSerum, a Serum node.  I am Sam Bankman-Fried.  I am involved in the development of Serum but have not been involved in the development of Sushi in any way.  This proposal is not on behalf of or related to FTX.  I have exposure to both SRM and SUSHI.


Proposal

The Sushi community builds out support for Sushiswap on Solana
Sushi rewards are paid to both Ethereum and Solana/Serum based Sushiswap
Proportional to the TLV in each
Or alternately fixed to each pool
The Sushi community composes this with the Serum orderbooks
Each Sushi pool has a curve, currently constant-product
The pool sends bids/offers into the associated Serum orderbook to simulate that curve
This allows the Sushi AMM to share liquidity and volume with the orderbook
FTX has a bridge from ERC20 <> SPL (Solana token) Sushi; in the next week, sollet.io will as well
Sushi will also be able to compose with a borrow/lending protocol on Serum to allow the pools to trade on margin, though that’s not necessary for V1

Rewards

EcoSerum, a Serum node that helps build out the community, will give the following rewards:
50k SRM for 1+2
1 locked MegaSerum for 1-5
One MegaSerum is 1 million Serum put together
This will allow the Sushi community to participate in Serum, run a node, receive yield, benefit from a buy/burn, and receive discounts
This will be locked (not sellable or transferable) for 1-7 years: fully locked until Aug 1 2021, and then unlocking linearly over the 6 years after that
These rewards are for the Sushi community, controlled by governance, to do what they want with
In addition, 20k SRM for 1+2 and another 10k for 1-5 to the team who builds it

Timeline

The target would be for pieces of this to roll out within a month, and completion before the end of 2020.  The assumption is that work would not start in earnest until after the Sushiswap migration is complete.

Let's face it, until we migrate the entire service to another blockchain, we are going to have to deal with paying ridiculously high GAS fees to ETH miners. And, it's already begun, in fact Mid-August saw total Ethereum GAS fees top a record $8.6 million in one day.

These GAS fees are like tapeworms that eat up all those great SUSHI gains LP's have come accustomed to seeing accrue on their screens. 

Proposal
Chef Nomi implements code enabling a button that will give LP's a choice of harvesting of the SUSHI tokens as a group maybe once every 3, 6, 9 or 12 hours to save on such fees-- the longer the wait, the greater the savings.

I realize this could be a lot of work to code, but I believe the GAS saving could be amazing. It will further incentivize LP's to reup and their restake even more ETH/SUSHI or other pairs, and at the very least, serve as a reward for those providing liquidity to the pool. 

I am not sure how much GAS we will save by doing this, but perhaps a portion of the savings could go back to the developers or go into a fund that will pay for the Nexus Mutual Insurance for the LPs or something like that. 

I don't have a UI mock-up or anything put together yet, but a fellow community member suggested a ""Karaoke Together"" button to allow this group harvesting capability. Below is how I imagine it working:

1. LP goes to sushiswap.org and connects his/her wallet
2. Clicks on the Home screen which instead of displaying only the existing 2 buttons showing your SUSHI balance and Total Supply;
3. The LP can choose 1 of 2 more buttons under a title ""HARVEST YOUR SUSHI"" 
4. Button One reads ""Harvest via TAKE OUT"" for solo harvesting which uses more GAS;

Of course there could be links that explain the process to the user before they choose the option best for them. 

I am hoping someone in the community can build this mock this up really quickly and give @NomiChef a better visual of how this could look in the future.

More details can be found on the website.

SWRV Contract Address: 0xb8baa0e4287890a5f79863ab62b7f175cecbd433

As of now, they have $400M+ locked in the protocol, just a few hours after launch.

This proposal seeks to add SWRV-ETH LP pool which would help create more liquidity for SWRV-ETH pool (currently it's quite low) and reward LPs with the same initial reward weight of 0.2x as was assigned for the Pools added in SIP-4.

To help this community recover, the following steps should be taken.

1. Chef Nomi transfers the dev fund, and admin keys over to a community elected multisig. The admin ownership stays with the multisig until direct community governance is vetted and ready.
2. All future decisions will be done by community vote and enacted by the multisig admins.
3. Chef Nomi will transfer all the LP tokens and Eth from the sold $SUSHI back to the multisig - as this was done without community vote.

After that, the community will hold two separate votes for:

A) A one time grant for Nomi for his work done. (I'd propose 200,000 $SUSHI vested over 3 years)
B) A wage for Nomi should he wish to continue to work on and develop the project.

In this model, Nomi and others would not have any status above any other member of the community. All decisions would be by community vote.

The dev fund will be used to support development on a grant basis through proposals and enacted by the multisig team.

This proposal give Nomi a chance to redeem his reputation, be compensated for the work he has done, and continue to work on the project while removing the systemic risk we've had so far.

It is also a chance for Nomi to show faith in community governance. Should the community vote for this proposal and Nomi not take the steps to return ALL funds to a multi-sig, then this project is truly dead."

Vote yes if you support this plan. Actual details to come in another proposal. Vote no if you support scrapping this plan and going back to the drawing board

Text of the tweet thread:

1) Now that the Sushi key has been transferred, it's time to transfer control to a multisig of myself and Larry Ce...
Just kidding.  Here's the actual plan (https://discord.com/channels/748031363935895552/748033004323995680/752077277390700605)

2) a) the old migration was tied to Nomi's key, so cancelling that.
b) replacing with an identical one tied to mine.
c) putting up a vote; if majority vote _against_ this migration in the next 12h we'll cancel it

3) going to transfer control to a multisig.
If you would like to be a member of this, please comment on this post with ""I would like to be a multisig key holder for sushi"".  We'll take the top 20 by likes, and have a proper vote on them.

4) will then transfer keys to that multisig group.
After that -- Sushi shall be back in the community's hands.
We'll put up a vote on this whole plan, if majority vote against then we'll scrap it and go back to the drawing board."

**TL;DR:**
- Right now, we are electing multisig holders who should sign transactions approved by the community.
- We need to clearly define community approval.
- This proposal is that signers should only sign transactions that have at least 3 voting days and pass with:

--  A 1% quorum at a 75% majority vote,
-- A 4% quorum at a 60% majority vote,
-- Or, a 6% quorum at a simple 51% majority vote.

- The exception being when user funds are at risk of exploit.


**Explanation:**

Right now, there is no minimums as to what constitutes a 'community decision' which means multisig signers would have to make a subjective judgement on if a vote has passed or not.

The only objective case right now would be if 100% voter turn out was met with a >51% majority vote.

Right now, if a vote received a 51% majority vote, but only had a 2k Sushi voting on it, or was only live for one hour of voting, it would be contested as to if the vote should pass or not.

For this sake, during the duration in which we have multisig signers, we should hold those multisig signers to an agreed standard.

From other examples we've seen with Compound, it is doable (although not easy) to get a 4% voter turnout on key issues.

We also know based on [The Law of Large Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers) that the more voters who vote, the more representative of the actual population the voting choice is. Therefore we can create a sliding scale.

I am proposing that:

A) All votes are scheduled for no less than 3 days.
B) Votes 'passing' are on a rated schedule of:

--  A 1% quorum at a 75% majority vote,
-- A 4% quorum at a 60% majority vote,
-- Or, a 6% quorum at a simple 51% majority vote.

This means the more voters who show up, the easier it is to pass the vote, as we can be more confident that it represents a vast majority of the users.

This prevents manipulation from whales or colluding whales, as well as people trying to sneak through quick votes.

But, it also gives grounds for votes to pass if they have low voter turn out but are still very popular, as we should recognize it is hard to motivate users into governance.

**Pros:**
- Clear rules for when signers should sign or not sign from a vote.
- Community now recognizes the vote thresholds needed and can hold signers accountable.
- Prevents votes being pushed through by a single whale, or colluding whales.
- Prevents votes being snuck through in quick turn around times.
- Allows votes to pass based on a confidence curve, not penalizing something for a low voter turnout if it is representative of a majority interest.
- Enforces the default state of proposals being rejected unless they are strongly desired by the community.

**Cons:**
- Leans towards denying votes on small issues that cannot get excitement for larger voter turnout (although attempts to address with thresholds)
- Slightly harder to keep track of as % are different at different levels."

TL;DR:

- It is time to formally hire 0xMaki to work full-time on SushiSwap so that he is ready to start running the show post migration.
- After the migration this vote would see 0xMaki work full time for the project.
- In turn he would be awarded 1M $SUSHI vested over a 12 month period (paid out monthly by the dev wallet signers)
- He would also receive a 1M $SUSHI one time grant upfront grant as the projects cofounder for the work he has done so far.
- The locked-up 1M $SUSHI can be withdrawn by community vote inline with voting rules.


**Explanation:**

0xMaki will work on and direct the project full-time, in exchange for compensation from the dev fund.

**Pros:**
- Humble full-time leadership.
- Delicious Sushi.

**Cons:**
- Our dev fund is a bit low from Nomi (but this grant is worth it.)"

**TL;DR:**

- The current emissions are too aggressive and do not properly incentivize long term participation in the ecosystem.
- This proposal aims to change the output of new $SUSHI and add a lock-up period to encourage participants to stay in the ecosystem longer.
- I'm proposing:
-- Cutting the emissions after the migration from 100 $SUSHI per block to:
--- 50 $SUSHI per block in Year 1 & 2
--- 25 $SUSHI per block in Year 3 & 4
--- 10 $SUSHI per block in Year 5
-Additionally:
-- 2/3rds of new $SUSHI issued is locked for a one year vesting period.
-- Locked $SUSHI is still able to earn fee payments but cannot be sold or used in voting until it is unlocked.

Explanation:

Right now the rate of $SUSHI inflation is too high and over dilutes individuals contributing to the ecosystem.

This scaled design aims to lower the emission of $SUSHI while still rewarding liquidity providers.

By lowering the token emission over time, the expectation is that $SUSHI's price will be rising and so that LPs can expect the same payout rate but not overly dilute the total supply.

The lock up period also allows them to earn from the token without the constant downward pressure.

Comparing the two models:
![](https://i.imgur.com/y5txkRd.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/ACiXkFb.png)

The proposed model would leave us with around 600M tokens in Year 5 instead of the 1.5B currently planned.

**Pros:**
- Rewards early participants.
- Lowers the emission of the token.
- Removes the downward sell pressure by creating a lockup.
- The lockup still allows users to gain upside from the project.
- Promotes long term involvement.

**Cons:**
- If token price doesn't rise fast enough it could be not enough to support LPs.
- Will have a disproportionate impact on our dev fund which was drained during the early bonus period."

What a 2 weeks these have been. We have suffered impermanent loss on our SushiSwap brand. ChefNomi took the devfund and stepped down from the project. SushiSwap was the most talked about projects of crypto. Luckily @SBF stepped in unexpectedly. His efforts have turned the tables completely around for SushiSwap. We migrated succesfully from Uniswap!

Problem:        We need to leave old SushiSwap behind and celebrate our new SushiSwap platform. That includes to step away from the old logo, wich was disgraced by ChefNomi. 


Proposal:        We will now have to rebrand SushiSwap and make this impermanent loss a gain for us all. The efforts of our front-end and back-end teams have thrived. We just need a new logo now and get rid of the old one, also to mark the start of a new era for SushiSwap.

That is why I propose:

           ------ The SushiSwap Dragonroll Logo Contest ------

Instructions
- Be creative, think out of the (bento)box and create the best logo for our SushiSwap.
- (To do for mods: Create a new channel in Omakase DAO for this contest.)
- Only artist creations of the new logo can be submitted in this channel. Format:  tba.

Price !!!
- The winner, who may from then onwards call oneself: 
**Master of Dragonrolls**, receives a grant total of 500 $SUSHI. The winning logo will become the new SushiSwap logo. 
- But there are more prices: 2nd place gets 200 $SUSHI. 3rd place  gets 50 $SUSHI. These logos will also be used somewhere on the platform.

Voting
- We will have a vote on the top 5 best logo submits.
- The community chooses the top 5 by voting using the :sushi~1: emoji in the contest channel. After that an official SUSHIPOWAH vote will occur.


May the most creative chef win.幸運を"

SushiSwap currently has no formal full-time team and a separate proposal (https://tinyurl.com/y3bge2xq) suggests hiring 0xMaki full-time. Members of the Sushi community have concerns with this proposal as it suggests paying 0xMaki over $1.4 million (@ current prices) upfront, which far exceeds fair market pay for the previous 2 weeks. Indeed, an actual member of the multi-sig has expressed concern over this isssue (https://tinyurl.com/y5qkozpz).

The purpose of this proposal is to allow the Sushi community to decide what portion of the total value granted should be upfront as opposed to vested. While it is crucial for SushiSwap to have a dedicated team, it is also imperative that community funds are used appropriately without the appearance of being a “slush fund”. This is doubly important given the prior debacle with ChefNomi, which considerably damaged the reputation of the project.

· Immutable smart contracts
· Publicly callable rebase mechanism
· Decentralized Oracle
· Fair distribution
· Rebases every 12 hours

We initially launched on Uniswap a month ago. In response to arbitrage attacks we were forced to fork REB and create REB2.
REB2 adds protection mechanisms that make it safe to trade on liquidity pools like SushiSwap, Uniswap or Balancer while doing rebases. 

We just (11.09.20) released REB2 and decided to launch it on SushiSwap.
PAIR: https://sushiswap.vision/pair/0xc4dE5Cc1232f6493Cc7BF7bcb12F905eb9742Bd7
Current Supply: ~ 2 Million REB2
MCAP: ~ 470k

We also started our LP incentive program on SushiSwap today.
More infos can be found here https://medium.com/@rebased/new-liquidity-provider-incentive-program-launched-on-sushiswap-c9848af84d4e

Current APR is above 2000%. We are taking a random snapshot every week and airdrop rewards to the wallets. 
So if we get a place on the SushiSwap menu LP would be able to farm REB2 and Sushi at the same time ;)

We would really appreciate a spot on the notorious SushiSwap Menu. It would be a boost for our liquidity and give our community and the SushiSwap community the opportunity for another exciting yield farming journey :)

The swap industry is developing so rapidly that if sushiswap cannot continue to move forward technically, it will definitely be eliminated by the market. Therefore, hiring a full-time top skilled DEV as the leader is so important to sushiswap.

The current proposals are all plans for full-time employment of maki, but I am here to remind everyone: to make room for the future of sushiswap.

If someone is more suitable to be the leader of sushiswap, are you willing to let him replace maki? I believe that if Maki is a really good person to sushiswap, he will certainly agree.

Sushiswap is no longer a small project. It carries a lot of liquidity and the interests of many token holders. The decision we make cannot be taken lightly and rashly. If it is just to make us happy, or to make someone happy, of course we can send out all the dev funds, but what about the future of sushiswap?

Therefore, I propose:

-A. Now carry out a quantitative assessment of the workload of all those who have made contributions in the community. Including chefnomi/maki/sbf and all developers, and operations staff.

-B. Refer to the salary paid by YFI to employees. 
links here:
https://gov.yearn.finance/t/nomination-for-roles-multisig-to-approve- execute/4549
To motivate all developers/operators, they must be encouraged!

-C. After completing the quantitative evaluation of the workload, refer to the evaluation data and recommend the leaders of sushiswap for the long-term development of sushiswap.

-D. Implement a tenure system for leaders (one year or other time).

Current proposals in the community with block reward decrease of 90-98% strongly damages APY for LP. As a result, a significant part of liquidity providers most likely will leave and with lower liquidity, we can't compete with other AMMs. 

Lowering inflation too early may lead to hazardous consequences for the ecosystem. Other proposals create imbalances between the interests of different groups of users of sushiswap and serve mostly whales with opportunistic aims. 

Three different groups of people use Sushiswap. Farmers, who provide liquidity. Holders of $SUSHI, who provide price and economics of $SUSHI. Casual traders, who seek high liquidity and pay fees. Without any of them, the ecosystem will die. Our proposal is intended to satisfy every party.

We propose to decrease block reward more slowly, however, to have less inflation on a distance:

The first month: 150 $SUSHI per block and $10mln buyback from funds received from @chefnomi to cover ""additional"" inflation.
The second month: 100 $SUSHI  per block and $4mln buyback.
For the next ten month: 80  $SUSHI per block.
Finally: 50  $SUSHI  per block for a second year.

With this plan, we will have much less inflation after one year as with 100 $SUSHI per block, and drop will be less damaging and slower. The buyback will compensate for inflation influence on price.
Any locking mechanism for newly minted tokens will lead to instant sells of unlocked part of the tokens."

Chef Nomi is the original founder of the Sushi Swap project. He is central to the founding myth of Sushi Swap. Nothing will change this fact.

Yes, he took SUSHI tokens from the devshare, dumped it for ETH, and made ridiculous excuses of why it was for the good of the community, despite saying he would not dump because he was a good guy.

But more importantly, he ended up doing the right thing. He gave the money back to the community. Now, the onus is on the community to complete the virtuous cycle of redemption. We have a choice to either be a vengeful, vindictive, unforgiving community, or one that believes that people make mistakes and we can bring the best out of people.

No matter what you think of his actions, Chef Nomi did contribute to creating the tremendous value that exists in SUSHI today. As such he deserves some form of a founder's bonus.

In addition, he is probably liable for paying tax on the SUSHI he took and sold into ETH. Just because he gave that money back, doesn't mean he avoids paying the tax on the money he made. 

The community can choose what bonus, if any, they think Chef Nomi should receive in this proposal.

--
0xMaki has been an essential part of Sushi since the beginning. Having him full time will be incredibly valuable for the project’s success long term. 0xMaki’s official start date would be Monday, September 14, 2020.

We agree with a lot of the feedback that the community has given on the previous proposal.  In particular we think that it’s important for the rewards to be vesting SUSHI over time, to align incentives and rewards with the success of the project and token.  We also think it’s important for the community to choose the scale, beyond just voting it up or down.

Instead of proposing a specific number of SUSHI for 0xMaki’s compensation, this proposal aims to create a bit more flexibility for the community to decide.

There is **no upfront grant**. This would be a **3 year vesting schedule**. It would be unlocked for 0xMaki block by block using [Sablier Protocol](https://sablier.finance/). If 0xMaki stops working on Sushi full-time, the community can vote to terminate this arrangement. At the community’s full discretion, they can add later bonuses based on performance (TVL/Volume/Revenue). This proposal only covers base compensation for 3 years of full-time work for 0xMaki. 

In addition, there would be **$10,000 per month** for salary and expenses.  This could be terminated at any point at the discretion of the community if the work is no longer important or satisfactory.

And similar to past proposals, once the voting is done, we will take the weighted average value to determine the final compensation for 0xMaki."

(This is a community poll to give guidance to the multisigs of what level of SushiPowah quorum the community thinks is fair to sign)

**TL;DR:**
-Right now there is no clear voting threshold.
-There is no team for core proposals and the community has not voted upon a minimum threshold for how many votes are needed to pass.
-This vote is to establish a minimum threshold.
-We'll establish that threshold based on a weighted average.
-Voting in favor of this vote means you believe it should be applied retroactively to the Sushi buyback proposal - but will not extend to other votes.

Explainer:
Right now, the multisigs have no clear guidance on what the community considers a fair minimum for votes and so votes that are close to a threshold can be contested.

This vote should establish the minimum number of votes that a proposal needs to pass as a **TEMPORARY** guideline until a core team is hired and puts forward a more robust proposal for a DAO."

I think it would be fair enough to send them a small one-time reward for their time and patience.

With this poll I'm asking you, the community, if you think we should reward our mods for their efforts, and maybe ask them if they are interested in working full time at our Discord.

After all, the only thing that makes us better than UniSwap at the moment is our community and the fact that we're truly decentralized (well, we still have whales but I guess that's part of the game) because all of us are part of something bigger.

And guess what?Our Discord server is crucial for our community, for its development and for its well-being, and this is why I think it's REALLY important to keep it clean and functional.

Also, our community exists in the first place because our volunteers stepped up and decided to spend their time for our project.

This is why I think we should reward them.
Don't ignore the silent but meaningful impact these guys have had on our community.
Don't undervalue our Discord server, because it will be crucial for the well being of our community: polls shouldn't be started only by multisig owners or other ""sushi-influencer"".

Also, lots of things need to be done:
- an antispam system should be implemented in our #general channel because of bots and scammers: these kind of people can ruin our ecosystem and surely it's not good for our image if we have a messy server with scammers spamming their links
- someone should actually EXPLAIN polls to the community, because 75% of the people in our server don't even understand why they're voting and most of them aren't voting at all
- we probably need someone to actually moderate our debates because I've read lots of interesting ideas but no one actually translated those ideas into a real poll, and lots of polls are simply IGNORED if they're not backed up by a moderator or a multisig; basically we need mods who understand a certain community sentiment and can translate that sentiment into a meaningful poll: look at what happened with the whole buyback story..the buyback won but we didn't have a QUORUM..we were voting without knowing how many votes would be enough to let the buyback pass
- and many other things

I think a small reward would be a fair and just incentive for these people to improve our community and keep doing the great job they're doing; right now our mods have to manually ban spammers from our servers, and yet I receive 3 or 5 spammy DMs per day.

Hence, I think we surely need someone working at our Discord server full-time, but that's another question: first let's decide if we should encourage moderators to work at our Discord server, and if yes, how much we should pay them (remember, this is a ONE-TIME PAYMENT...something like a ""thank you for your work until now,we love your job.Will you keep working for us in the near future?"")

- If no wins: we don't pay anything
- If yes wins: we pay them with weighted average"

ANT holders will grant $50k to community proposals through the new Conviction Voting app.

The Aragon community knows well the challenges of on-chain governance. Plutocracy, vote-buying, Sybil attacks, last-minute vote changes, on-chain voter apathy, to name a few. But new tools are emerging to help overcome these challenges. Conviction voting is one such tool. We want the Aragon community to test, understand, validate, and refine the mechanism. 

The recent governance explosion makes this pilot especially relevant to the DeFi landscape. Conviction Voting eliminates the governance bottleneck of large distributed communities. DeFi communities could manage on-chain revenues, mint tokens, or run grant programs themselves.

The Conviction Funding program culminated research and development from multiple teams, including Aragon One, 1Hive, BlockScience, and the Commons Stack. Extensive simulation and testing work has been done in collaboration between Aragon One and Block Science in preparation for the Conviction Funding program. 

The Aragon Association will fund the Conviction Funding program. This program will be run on an Aragon DAO with a treasury of 9k ANT (currently valued at $60,390). Proposal submissions and voting will start on Thursday, August 27, and end on Thursday, October 8 (6 weeks).

There seems to be a general consensus that it would be good to reduce unlocked SUSHI emissions in favor of locked emissions.

The current consensus based on past polls seems to be that ⅔ of the SUSHI emissions should be locked and ⅓ should be unlocked.  Some also want to take down total emissions, others don’t.  In addition there has been discussion of a hard cap on Sushi supply.

This poll is to establish two things:

Should we move forward with that?
If so, which of two implementation paths should we follow?

One path is to fully implement this, and then release it; that will likely take a few weeks.

Another path is to first reduce emissions, and then implement the locked up parts and retroactively reward liquidity providers with the locked portion.

Taking emissions down can be done by pointing them at a dead pool.  Vesting can be done by pointing them at a pool controlled by a contract which implements vesting.  Temporary measures could be done by reducing total emissions if desired with a dead pool, and then pointing vesting emissions at a pool controlled by the multisig which would later redistribute, locked, to stakers.  There are other ways to do these as well.

So here is a poll.


Note: this will take a minimum of 300k total SUSHIPOWAH to pass

Option 1: ⅔ of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, ⅓ unlocked; wait to change anything until fully ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever

Option 2: ⅔ of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, ⅓ unlocked; immediately take emissions down by 66%, and then apply the locked portion (including retroactively) once the code is ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever

Option 3: Take total emissions down by 50%; ⅔ of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, ⅓ unlocked; wait to change anything until fully ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever

Have a set of reward pools that rotate to bring in new liquidity and users to SushiSwap and stay relevant

**Abstract**
SushiSwap is an AMM (Automated Market Maker). This is the core business. Value of the core business grows when we get more liquidity (providing less slippage for users) and more volume (providing more rewards to LPs and SUSHI holders). The main tool we have for bringing in liquidity is the SUSHI reward pools. We should therefore optimize how we deploy these pools to increase value.

Instead of locking ourselves into a fixed set of pools I propose that we keep a core set of fixed pools and add a rotating set of pools to continually stay relevant and bring in the highest value pools. Let’s call it the ‘Menu of the week’.

How we pick the pools to be included could be:

- The highest volume pools on Uniswap (to bring that volume to SushiSwap, maybe need to skip pairs that have high volume because they are incentivized as UniSwap LP on another platform)
- The highest volume pools on SushiSwap (to encourage new tokens to start on SushiSwap instead of elsewhere)
- Do a community vote
- Let 0xMaki decide
- Other ways

**Specification**
I think we can have long discussions about this, but meanwhile we’re losing value, so I propose we just pick 10 pools that make some sense and assign them a reward of 0.2x to kick things off. The reward will only last 7 days and by then we should have the next list.

- xSUSHI-ETH (That’s our token, we should have some liquidity)
- cDAI-DAI (earn COMP, compound interest, trading fees AND SUSHI)
- WBTC-ETH ($21M volume in UniSwap)
- CREAM-ETH (even better if we can be one of the CREAM reward pools, but let’s at least have some liquidity here, we’ll pick up volume through arb)
- MEME-ETH (low liquidity and high volume on UniSwap, tip from discord)
- wNXM-ETH (add some relevance to our pairs)
- yUSD-ETH (because cool, maybe pair with stablecoin instead)
- renBTC-WBTC (lots of idle capital sitting around here)
- yUSD-WBTC (0xMaki choice)
- CRO-ETH ($3B marketcap, sitting idle)

Yes, yes, yes, I know… you all have opinions on which pairs should be listed, let’s leave that for later. (Some changes were made on 0xMaki's input) I tried to pick a bit of a wild list with several experiments… some might work, some might not… it’s only 7 days and only a 0.2x reward multiplier. I recommend here we choose action over endless debate and just start with this and figure out how to decide a weekly update as we go on.

**Why?**
- Bring in new liquidity
- Bring in new users into the ecosystem (different coins, different groups)
- Bring more volume
- Stay relevant, create buzz around new pools
- Fun!

**Why not?**
Other pools lose a small amount of yield. Longer term we can probably retire some of the main pools."

- Small projects done by freelancers
- Translations
- Other marketing expenses
- And I’m sure many other cool things

**Specification**
Every month the team requests the Growth fund to be topped up by the multi-sig. Team will report at least weekly on expenses paid. Of course the goal is NOT to empty the fund each month, but to have enough to not get slowed down by running out. Each month the fund will get topped up to the set amount. So it’s the maximum amount, to be spent with care and accountability.

Initially funds will be under control by @0xMaki (since he’s CEO) and are his responsibility. He may choose to provide smaller budgets to other team members as needed.

**For**
- Only need to annoy the multi-sig signers once per month (most aren’t directly involved with Sushi)
- Significantly speed up operations and allows for much faster iteration of ideas
- Keeps volunteers happy, as some have been “promised” some rewards or at least reimbursement of expenses but are yet to see any
- Create a lot of fun and community engagement with small prize contests, etc

**Against**
- Community doesn’t have full control over every SUSHI spent

**Poll**
What is the maximum Growth fund size the team should top up to monthly? (We’ll use weighted average)"

Platforms like Compound and Aave allow users to deposit assets as collateral and borrow other assets against this. These protocols have attracted billions of dollars, but they suffer from some major limitations. Taking away these limitations could see much larger adoption. This proposal aims to do just that.

**Abstract**
We solve these issues by having a platform with:

- Isolated lending pairs. Anyone can create a pair, it’s up to users which pairs they find safe enough. Risk is isolated to just that pair.
- Flexible oracles, both on-chain and off-chain.
- Liquid interest rates based on a specific target utilization, such as 75%.
- Contracts optimized for low gas.
- The supplied assets can be used for flash loans, providing extra revenue for suppliers.

**Specification**
All the details are in this detailed Medium post: https://medium.com/@boringcrypto/the-bentobox-lending-solution-1351606b9f5a

**Proposal**
I will commit to delivering well tested (but not yet audited) solidity contracts closely matching the specs above. Slight changes may occur due to technical feasibility, but will be clearly communicated when encountered.

The success fee for this project is 25k SUSHI at the beta release and an additional 75k at final delivery.

Any costs of freelancers I may use for things such as creating unit tests, etc and any other expenses I have will be mine. The core code will of course be written by me.

Delivery deadline for a beta release will be 3 weeks from the time the funds are approved. Final delivery will be within 6 weeks. Every day delayed after that will reduce success fee by 5%.

While I may create a UI for testing purposes, it isn’t included in this proposal. But I will work with the team and provide help/guidance where needed so a good UI can be ready for launch."

They have been involved since the start of the project and have been doing a lot of work on the current product and future UI. I think it made sense to have both join the team in a full time manner to consolidate our efforts and to ensure things keep moving.

Here is a short bio/proposal of OmakaseBar :

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EVnNW-GWIjKLS5scPzgo-XsuiPcq6q49/view

Here is the bio of JiroOno :

Hello I’m Jiro Ono, an anon developer that has contributed throughout the space
under various pseudo names. Anonymity is important to me, and I believe it
one of the important pillars in crypto which is why I choose to stay anon for the
time being.

TLDR - I consider myself a full stack engineer, with a unique skillset
in big data and machine learning. A wearer of many hats, and I have extensive
experience working with many different languages/technologies.Have been a
follower and contributor in crypto for a number of years, and a big believer in
decentralized/community owned projects.

Though I am anon, I believe it is important to give the community my complete
background (minus the specific details), and to stay as transparent I can. So
here’s my story:

Started programming when I was 13, and currently have 15 years of experience
under my belt working in several industries and with various tech stacks.

In my early days, I started with scripting languages to develop bots that I’m
sure many of you saw being used on various social media sites to help with
many affiliate marketing campaigns I operated.

Started my first successful project when I was in my later teens, that involved
working with several freelancers to help build out the platform. This is where I
first became accustomed to the open source, and freelancing community.

I then went to school in the States, and completed my Masters in Computer Engineering
with a focus in big data and machine learning. During my time in uni, I worked for
a startup centered around machine learning and helped build out some of the key
data pipelines and ml interfaces.

After uni, I got a job in cefi with a well known bank. I worked in the ML
department, and specifically worked on a crucial product that is still used today
to determine the risk levels of potential customers. This is where I initially became
frustrated with the legacy banking system, and discovered crypto currencies.

While working for this bank, a couple of other devs and I started a
crypto project right before the big boom of 2017. After starting this project,
I decided to leave my job to focus full time on the endeavor. Though it was quite
the ride working in the space during the bull market, we didn’t make it through the
crash and ended up dissolving the project due to lack of funds.

Since then, I’ve worked on various part time projects within ML and the crypto
space. Where my focus/attention has primarily been in Ethereum, and web3 technologies.
I’ve bounced around quite a bit during this time frame, and up until sushi was
primarily building stuff for my own use.

So why am I here, and why do I want to become a core member of SushiSwap?

For one, the complete decentralization and community driven aspect is very
enticing for me. I’m a big believer in community owned projects, and the power
of the community is quite special.

The resiliency of the community and the group of volunteers that devoted
a lot of their time during the pre/post migration phase. Truly a special moment
to witness, and especially working with all of the others behind the scenes on
the successful migration.

A kick ass project, something I’m sure you all are aware of. But it’s worth
highlighting, because the opportunity ahead of us is something we as a community
should truly be excited to be a part of.

Overall, my aspirations for this project are quite high and I couldn’t think of
a much better use of my time then to commit fully to the SushiSwap community.
The community aspect is quite valuable, and I as one of the lead devs want to
make sure that we get a system in place that streamlines the process for others
to get involved and contribute in a decentralized/secure manner.

I’d like to have some feedback and thoughts on both and if community is willing to move forward.

In my opinion they are exceptional candidates and some might have asked why this wasn’t posted before, I needed to have all of the elements presented here before moving forward while respecting a small cooldown period and no-pressure environment for both.

Note : Same compensation for both official starting date would be 5 October."

The original proposal can be viewed here: https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/moonbeam-sushiswap-proposal/375

Moonbeam is an Ethereum compatible smart contract platform built on Substrate, that will be deployed as a parachain on both the Kusama and Polkadot networks.

The plan to launch on Kusama and Polkadot is as follows:
- Take a snapshot of all SUSHI balances on Ethereum mainnet (xSUSHI and SUSHI/ETH SLP will be allocated correctly)
- Deploy SushiSwap on a new network (Kusama/Polkadot)
- Airdrop $moonSushi to all holders in the snapshot
- Airdrop a small amount of the native token to each account, the equivalent of ETH, which should be enough for many many transactions.

Your $moonSUSHI can be freely traded on MoonBeam and on the MoonBeam SushiSwap deployments there will be LP pools that earn $moonSUSHI as well as a 'SushiBar on the moon', where you get xMoonSushi, etc...

SushiSwap on MoonBeam should give access to trade many new assets on MoonBeam, Kusama, Polkadot and many Polkadot Parachains. Ethereum assets may also becomes available through bridges (similar to renBTC, tBTC on Ethereum).

$SUSHI, $moonSUSHI on Kusama and $moonSUSHI on Polkadot will be independent, each with their own 250M max cap.

MoonBeam is providing 0.25% of all genesis native tokens to SushiSwap. A good portion of these will be distributed in the airdrop. Some may be used for other incentives and/or to compensate those managing the airdrops and deployments.

If the airdrop and deployments cannot be done by the core team, external contributors (such as @LevX and @BoringCrypto) will be used. 0xMaki will negotiate reasonable payment in SUSHI and/or native tokens with them.

The aim is to launch within days of MoonBeam going live, giving SUSHI holders instant access to try this new and exciting technology without any friction (as you'll already have some native tokens and moonSUSHI)."

I will mention the highlights (but I think it is worth reading)

full-stack developer with a strong passion for UI/UX design and skills ranging from web, app and backend development, including solidity.

strong work ethic : I’m usually awake between 4:00 GMT and 20:00 GMT. My working hours are flexible, but, on average, I work about 10 hours per day.

Location : East Asia

Salary : 60k USDC + range of 250k-350k SUSHI streamed over sablier.finance 

Levx added an edit ( 10% would go to charity )

Maki Thoughts :

I think this is a nobrainer for the project to hire someone that has been dedicated to the protocol and continue to be implicated, driven and responsive about Sushiswap.

His ethos resonate with mine and I believe that his salary even if it might seems high in SUSHI is a bullish bet. He has been with us and kept building while the price was at the very bottom.
(his salary was based on SUSHI price before the recent price action)

It would be streamed like the rest of the core team so only 1/12 would be released monthly and cancelled if he quits the project.

It is very difficult to find developers with his skillset willing to take a bet on such a new cryptoasset keep this in mind thank you.

Community Member Wasabi Thoughts :

I am more than happy to share my view here. I remember that @levx was not overwhelmingly welcomed at first when he posted his first lite.sushiswapfi here in this channel. Despite that, he kept adding the 1-click migration and Limit order as well with our leadership’s and member’s support. I was impressed by the quick and timely delivery of all the features he has delivered. I personally used his 1-click migration using my real money, which was smooth. I anticipate he will have to contribute to our project as a core dev. @0xMaki, Thanks for your leadership on this too!

Following the polls on the forum I added 2 choices for the salary which were the most voted on 250k & 300k.

With an increase in security breaches in smart contracts and the crypto space as a whole, it is indeed a scary time for us all. 

This proposal has two parts that will help build a synergistic relationship between SushiSwap and Cover Protocol:

An incentivized COVER-ETH SushiSwap pool.

SushiSwap uses an allocation of its treasury to help provide exploit protection to its community. Coverage would be provided in the event of a hack, bug, exploit or economic manipulation attack.

We believe SushiSwap’s vision aligns very well with Cover Protocol’s vision; both are innovative, growth-minded and community driven projects that put security first.

Who Are We?

Cover Protocol is a protocol that is focused on protecting and covering the DeFi community in the unfortunate event of a hack, bug, exploit and or economic manipulation attack. We provide coverage on smart contracts for anyone that needs it. Our coverage does not require KYC, is fungible, infinitely scalable and the price of coverage is determined by the market.

Proposal Details :

Create a COVER-ETH pool on SushiSwap which will be incentivized by Sushi Token at a 0.1x 

Cover Protocol will create its own farm where users can deposit COVER-ETH sushi farm tokens to earn COVER token as well. 

A 3 month pool may be a good place to start.

This will help drive more liquidity towards SushiSwap along with trading fees by making SushiSwap the defacto place to trade COVER token… It will also allow the SushiSwap Community to earn Cover Tokens.

Allow for the treasury to allocate a portion of its funds towards being a market maker and/or coverage provider by minting CLAIM and NOCLAIM tokens and providing liquidity with those tokens. In order to make the price of coverage on SushiSwap as affordable as possible, we recommend that SushiSwap become a coverage provider or market maker. This has the additional benefit that the treasury will gain financially as long as there is no exploitation on SushiSwap. We leave it up to the community to determine how much liquidity to provide.
Benefits of coverage provider :

Show confidence in your project’s security.
Earn premium(s) by selling CLAIM tokens.
Cheap coverage opportunities for your community to stay protected.
Earn $COVER for staking NOCLAIM LP BPT tokens.
Earn balancer fees by providing liquidity in the pool(s).
Redeem collateral back as long as there is no claim.
The $COVER token is accumulated by those providing liquidity, providing coverage and participating in $COVER shield mining. This means the protocol and its users can have a say in Cover Protocol’s governance and the future of coverage in DeFi.
Incentivize your own token as well!
Benefits of market maker :

Cheap and low slippage coverage for your community to stay protected.
Earn $COVER for staking CLAIM and NOCLAIM LP BPT tokens.
Earn balancer fees by providing liquidity in the pool(s).
Redeem collateral back as long as there is no claim.
The $COVER token is farmed by those providing liquidity, providing coverage and participating in $COVER shield mining. This means the protocol and its users can have a say in Cover Protocol’s governance and the future of coverage in DeFi.
Incentivize your own token as well!

Maki thoughts : 

Cover Protocol paid out their first exploit (Pickle finance) and listed first on Sushiswap I think it is worth rewarding and making sure that our next products under the Sushi umbrella are covered. 

Starting with a 0.1x alloc for 3 months with a following vote to keep or end the rewards would be a good start.

A range of coverage will be proposed with this vote.

Based on our treasury I think : 
- 350 000 DAI
- 250 000 DAI
- 100 000 DAI
Nothing

Would be fair.

Keep in mind we will need to sell SUSHI to pass this proposal.

A second proposal vote will decide how to get the DAI."

Introducing Onsen, our new liquidity mining incentivization program, a replacement of our Menu of the Week initiative intended to bring positive long-term liquidity changes as well as ensure stability of our platform.

Bringing new liquidity onto our exchange, decreasing slippage, expanding our pool offerings and creating exciting synergistic partnerships with other DeFi projects. Onsen allows tokens that are voted to become accredited to participate in our liquidity mining program.

58 tokens pairs will be eligible to receive accreditation. Every 60 days, the accredited list is re-evaluated to ensure that there is maximum capital efficiency for the SushiSwap ecosystem.

Onsen has 2000 allocation points (AP) set aside for it. These AP are what determine how much of our new token emissions (SUSHI minting) are awarded to incentivized Onsen pairs, the same way we allocate rewards to the permanent menu.

So how do we decide what token deserves what percentage of rewards? And how do we ensure that it benefits both the project in question and SushiSwap’s protocol as a whole?

By using a new weighting method to ensure that accredited tokens receive allocation points proportionate to their market cap!

Out of the 2000 AP, MISO (Minimal Initial Sushi Offering) projects get to take part of a 200 AP reserve that will initially be reserved for 3 months.

The remaining 1800 AP are divided based on the market cap size of the applicant token. To keep this manageable, we have created 3 categories according to market cap size average;

Midcap (25m-100m Market cap)

13 pairs maximum
100 AP per pair
Lowcap (25m-5m Market cap)

25 pairs maximum
20 AP per pair
Gems (5m-1m Market cap)

20 pairs maximum
10 AP per pair
We will make it easy for projects to contribute to a Joint Liquidity Mining contract in a few weeks by releasing a wrapped MasterChef contract where they will be able to distribute their own tokens in addition to Sushi. (Double the yield!)

As there are some projects already participating in a Joint Liquidity Mining initiative with us, or moving their liquidity to SushiSwap, we will accredit $AMPL, $zLOT and $SEEN tokens from the very beginning.

Applying to the Onsen program, applicants must send 1000 SUSHI or 2 ETH to be used in permanent, irrevocable liquidity provisioning in the SUSHI-ETH pool to ensure serious projects are partaking in the process.

This accounts for a total of 58 pairs, contributing a total of 58 000 SUSHI burned or 116 ETH locked in liquidity every 90 days (Note: For the first round the first 25 pairs to apply won’t have to contribute any fee), as specified per basic application requirements seen in the next section.

We are voting today to bring onboard 4 new core devs

-BoringCrypto
 -Clearwood 
-I’m Software 
 -Joseph Delong

I’ll do a small prompt for each candidates and why they were selected  (I’ve added “titles” but I believe they mean nothing in an org like SushiSwap):   -BoringCrypto (architect - core dev)  Any community members involved in the Discord or Forum knows him.   He is behind BentoBox and crucial in our development cycle.   You can read more about him in this proposal : 
https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/hire-boringcrypto-me-as-lead-architect-for-sushi/1699  

 -Clearwood (core dev)  Clearwood joined Sushiswap a few months ago he has been involved in the QA and various other tasks of BentoBox and sushi-data. He is a very prolific contributor and has been selected because I believe he is essential to the continuity of the project.
 You can read a proposal he posted here : https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/team-proposal-clearwood/1591 

-I’m Software (core dev)   I’m Software has been involved in the amazing https://analytics.sushiswap.fi ,  and in a range of tasks that are deemed an extraordinary contribution by everyone in the core team.   He wrote a little more about himself here : https://hackmd.io/6g6GEMzPTMWlC6Dl77bM-A    -Joe Delong (CTO-core dev)  

Our last hire would be Joseph, he is our newest addition and less known by community members. He would join the core team as someone who can add a dimension of management and technical knowledge, which is key.  I am highly confident that his participation will be instrumental and his direction concerning our L2 decisions will highly profit us, from his deep knowledge of the Ethereum protocol. He is an ex-ConsenSys, Eth2 Core Developer, and previously Cruise Director of TXRX Ethereum 2.0 research team.   Compensation :  BoringCrypto would receive a different compensation considering a few factors.  - He has been involved since the beginning and we judged it was fair for him to be on the same playing field as the earlier core team members for this reason.   60k USD + 250k Sushi (identical to Levx contract)  75k Sushi (rest of the grant for BentoBox)   removal of the 1% dev share to BentoBox   9% -> 10% to xSushi holders   Vested 1 year via Sablier.finance   Clearwood - I’m Software - Joe  They will be entitled to the new hiring guidelines decided by the community.   From what surfaced so far :

- A variable base compensation of 0 USDC to 120k USDC (decided by the team member in line with their risk appetite)
- Rest of the compensation paid in Sushi with a cap to 300k in total remuneration the peg price for Sushi has been set at the 22 December when the negotiation for salary were started by 0xMaki.
- A signing bonus of 20k Sushi.
- Cliff of 1 month before starting the Sushi sablier in case the hire is unsuccessful or not a good fit  (the team reserve the right to terminate the hire if deemed necessary)
- Sushiswap will cover any legal fees if needed

Sushi Vesting :
Almost three months ago, we’ve agreed[1] 13 to vest ⅔ of newly minted Sushi for 6 months. There was no clear implementation of the vesting and its release, and it ended up being more of a workaround controlled by the multi-sig.

We’re slowly coming closer to the 6-month mark, which means that we start figuring out the distribution and its details.

Option #1: Airdrop the vested Sushi at the 6-month mark and get rid of the vesting. The transaction costs would be subtracted from the total airdrop amount, spreading the costs evenly between the receivers. The total number of vested Sushi at the 6-month mark should be ~47,040,732.

Option #1.1: Airdrop the vested Sushi monthly beginning at the 6-month mark (end of March) and get rid of the vesting. This would increase transaction costs a bit but at the same time would decrease the sudden inflation.

The Sushi would be airdropped beginning with the smallest balances, ending with the highest ones.

Option #2: Similar approach to Balancer’s claims - use a smart contract that would allow claiming every week. This would cost us almost nothing, but the receivers would have to bear much higher gas costs, possibly preventing smaller farmers from claiming their Sushi.

Option #1+2: Airdrop vested balances under 1000 Sushi, get rid of the vesting, use the smart contract approach for bigger balances.

All of these options are broken down in the forum post[2].

Team’s thoughts
Option 1 is preferred, primarily because it’s the lowest risk. This is $300M+ worth of SUSHI, so a mistake could be very costly. The simpler the code for this, the better.

The goal of option 1.1 may be to spread out the inflation, but I’m not convinced we understand the impact of a single release (ripping off the band-aid) vs. a prolonged period of increased inflation. So I’d prefer the simpler solution.

If the whales are ok with us charging them the tx costs, that’s ok, but the dev fund paying these works for me too.

Overall I don’t feel very strongly about this, option 2 feels unfair towards smaller balances, but option 1+2 fixes that. As long as we get some serious audits done on the code, certainly with option 2 or 1.1.

(There was talk about ‘withholding’ some drops from farms, etc. I assume that idea has been abandoned (I hope so)? Not to be confused with helping farms drop directly to their users, which seems like a great idea.)


Option 1 would be preferred for simplicity. I believe the market will price this in quickly, and it’s less prone to human error.

Option 2 is a better solution and the Sushi not claimed can go back in the treasury after x amount of weeks. I think withholding Sushi to specific smart contracts is also important since their sole purpose is to sell. We should make sure community members are rewarded instead of mercenary liquidity. If MarketMakers are aware of this change in fundamentals well in advance there won't be any impact on the price and everyone will be properly hedged out so the sudden release shouldn't have much impact similar to what happened with the recent SOL unlock.

The original proposal and community dialogue can be viewed here: https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/codename-bonsai-proposal-for-building-out-sushiswap-on-solana-and-serum/2653/25

We're really excited and humbled to see both the success of Raydium so far, and the general support of the idea of a partnership in the SushiSwap community to support the building out of many key Sushi features on Solana and Serum.

We’re also grateful for the feedback received on the initial proposal and during the recent conversation at the Sushi Forum on Discord. We’ve heard a lot about what the community would like to see and have worked out additional details on the partnership and what execution would look like.

Key areas are outlined below:
* Bonsai: The addition of SushiSwap pools on Solana
* SushiSwap and Raydium partnership
* Bonsai pool structure and incentives
* Fees, performance and protocol dynamics
* Platform integration

**Bonsai: The addition of SushiSwap pools on Solana:**

The purpose of this partnership is to allow Sushi to expand its reach and community to Solana and Serum, with the initial and primary feature of creating new SushiSwap liquidity pools (LPs) on these ecosystems *in addition* to existing Ethereum based LPs. 

The key point here is that LPs built out by Raydium will be an addition to Sushi’s current pools. This *is not* a liquidity migration, but a method for Sushi to create new pools which are able to leverage the speed and efficiency of Solana, interact with the liquidity of Serum’s central order book, and expand to reach a wider community and project base. Sushi’s Ethereum based pools will remain untouched and as is.

As the objective is to extend the reach of SushiSwap, Bonsai pools aim to focus on projects on Solana and Serum. Bonsai could be thought of similar to Onsen, as a way to branch out to Solana-native assets and grow along with the projects in the ecosystem.

For the SushiSwap user, these Solana based pools would appear as a new page on the SushiSwap UI, named Bonsai. This page would have similar front-end functionality and GUI to current Sushi Farms and Onsen pools, but would simply connect to Raydium’s backend for execution. A similar SushiSwap page would also be implemented on Raydium’s front-end. Mockups for proposed pages can be found on the original proposal


**SushiSwap and Raydium partnership**

With the objective of ensuring a long-term partnership where both teams are on the same path, it’s important to align incentives. In order to achieve this:

* Sushi and Raydium would agree to a token swap to ensure mutual commitment
* We propose an exchange of 1% of the total RAY supply (5.55m tokens) at a favorable price of $0.325 per RAY for an equivalent value ($1.8m) of SUSHI at market price. 
* At $0.325 per RAY, this indicates a FDV for Raydium at $180m, while the RAY would hold a current market price of approximately $55m at the time of writing
* These favorable terms are put forward in order to maintain the integrity and price of a previously discussed token swap with the Sushi team and to further show long term commitment to the relationship from Raydium.
* RAY tokens would come from Raydium’s Partnership & Ecosystem reserve.
* Tokens on both sides would be locked with a one year cliff and vesting linearly over the following 24 months.

**Bonsai pool structure and incentives**

The vision for Bonsai is a branch of SushiSwap that extends and focuses on key projects on Solana, and this would initially focus on Solana-native assets such as SOL, SRM, and FIDA for example. As the ecosystem grows, Bonsai would grow alongside it and incorporate additional relevant pools into Sushi’s offering which would otherwise be a challenge for Sushi to include.

1 - SUSHI incentives
We propose a SUSHI incentive structure for Bonsai similar to that of Onsen, which relies on 2,000 allocation points (AP) distributed to each pool relative to the project’s total market cap. 

However instead of a tiered system based on market cap, we propose tiers based on Total Value Locked (TVL) for Bonsai. This would mean that APs are allocated based on the pools’ TVL on the Bonsai platform, which then determines the SUSHI incentives distributed to LPs.

![](https://i.ibb.co/9GzxNdg/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-19-01-56.png)

By using a TVL model for the AP tiers, this structure encourages greater liquidity on Bonsai and naturally selects for higher quality projects. 

2 - Expected Total and SUSHI TVL

While we expect Bonsai to start out with a smaller number of Solana focused pools, it’s important to set a maximum cap for the number of pools. We propose this to be capped at 40, a significantly smaller number than Onsen’s 58, to ensure that pools and SUSHI incentives are reserved for high quality projects. We also propose that 10 of the 40 pools be reserved as SUSHI pairs to further incentivize and lock SUSHI liquidity. This means that approximately 12.5% of all TVL on Bonsai will be in the form of SUSHI.

As a function of the tiered pool structure, the relative TVL, and the APs assigned, we estimate that overall TVL for Bonsai will amount to between $180M and $620M when the max pool cap of 40 is reached. This translates to between $22.5M and $77.5M of SUSHI TVL in the pools.

3 - RAY incentives (Double Yield)

With both SushiSwap and Raydium working together, Raydium would incentivize Bonsai pools with the native RAY token. Total RAY incentives would be equal to or greater than the total SUSHI rewards distributed to Bonsai LPs. This means attractive double yields for farms on Bonsai, similar to what is discussed in the SushiSwap MIRIN article for franchised pools. We see this as an immediate value add for the community and a strong competitive advantage which is likely to increase reach and liquidity for Sushi Bonsai pools. 

Raydium would work alongside the SushiSwap team to determine appropriate double yield rewards for specific pools that the community wishes to incentivize.

4 - Incentives for xSUSHI holders

In line with SushiSwap’s SUSHI staking rewards, 0.05% of fees will be collected from Bonsai trades as rewards for xSUSHI. These fees will be used to buy SUSHI from Bonsai pools and then that SUSHI will be sent over to SushiSwap on Ethereum to reward xSUSHI holders. This is a clear method for xSUSHI holders to benefit from the expansion of Sushi.

**Fees, performance and protocol dynamics**

Many questions were brought up about the numbers behind Raydium so we’ve covered the below questions in a reply to the original proposal. If you’d like to dive deeper, you can view that here: https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/codename-bonsai-proposal-for-building-out-sushiswap-on-solana-and-serum/2653/64?u=gamma
1)  How will fees be split between LPs, Sushi and Raydium?
2)  How do Serum fees work and how is Raydium able to earn 30bps per trade for Bonsai?
3)  So why trade on Bonsai or Raydium if the cost is the same?
4)  Won’t competition from other liquidity providers impact Raydium’s volume and profits?
5)  How do you deal with arbitrageurs in a fast moving and low fee environment?
6)  So if traders get better slippage, LPs capture more profits while arbitrageurs can still make their share, then who’s losing?
7)  What is this Fibonacci sequence you’re talking about?

**Platform Integration**

Upon passing of the proposal, Raydium will commit the majority of resources to working alongside the SushiSwap team to start building out support for Bonsai pools on Solana, with a proposed plan for estimated timing and resources as below:

* Raydium has all front-end JavaScript connections already prepared for use by Sushi. Ideally, Sushi would be able to provide a front-end developer and/or designer to connect these in line with Sushi UI standards. However, Raydium is also able to go ahead and produce this page within 4-5 days. 
* Raydium would need 3-4 days to make sure that all of Sushi’s functions are properly recreated
* At least another 3-4 days is recommended for comprehensive testing from both teams before launch.
* Setting up of a parallel page on Raydium for Sushi Bonsai pools could be done in 2-3 days.

The entire process could likely be completed within a couple of weeks, however communication, finalizing of details, and testing may add to that. Following the completion of the initial Bonsai pools, Raydium would continue to work closely with Sushi to provide full support on Bonsai as well as for additional features wherever it seems most valuable for the community."

Summary :

Badger DAO and UMA protocol are collaborating to enable users that have their WBTC/ETH Sushi LP or Badger (Currently about $325M worth) positions staked in the Badger Sett Vaults, to mint synthetic stablecoins (we call them sCLAWS and bCLAWS). We like to partner with Sushiswap for this new product initiative with the purpose of giving Sushi LP’s the ability to borrow against their positions while earning interest. The intention is for this to be the first test of this with subsequent similar launches to follow.

We are going to create an exclusive liquidity pool on Sushi for each CLAW paired with USDC. There will be subsequent incentivized vaults on Badger for users to deposit those SLP tokens with active strategies.

Badger and UMA are splitting LP incentives for this initiative and we are proposing Sushiswap join us as an equal partner. Weekly incentive of SUSHI for each of these pools would be higher than the current Onsen program permits. Through Badger vaults, any Sushi that is earned by the LP’s will automatically be staked for xSushi and distributed back to the users in that token.

We believe through this collaboration together we could create the largest LP pools available on Sushiswap while bringing a unique product offering that drives new value for DeFi participants. We anticipate 100m’s in additional liquidity and trading volume along with the subsequent fees.

Our intention is to move forward with this initiative quickly as the underlying technological requirements are almost complete.


What are the appropriate incentives for these vaults/liquidity pools?

Each vault would have a cap on the maximum amount of capital allowed and life cycle of each vault (8 weeks). For the sCLAWS/USDC SLP that would be $250M and for the bCLAWS/USDC SLP that would be $75M. By doing this we can create a floor for the minimum amount of APY users would receive.

Important to note: Having caps on the vaults doesn’t mean there wouldn’t be more than that minted in synthetic stablecoins. I foresee users minting for the purpose of converting to USDC in the highly liquid Sushiswap pool. Further increasing trading volume and fees for Sushiswap.

Based on our experience, to incentivize these vaults to reach capacity we feel 25% APY on sCLAWS/USDC SLP and 50% APY bCLAWS/USDC SLP would potentially accomplish this.

Another driving force for this is the fact that the SUSHI pools will be primarily 2 stablecoins on each side which would mitigate Impermanent loss implications and further attract LPs.

Badger, UMA, SUSHI would split these rewards evenly 3 ways. To achieve the above APY targets we would need;

$1,201,923 weekly rewards for the wbtc/eth SLP collateralized vault (sCLAWS/USDC)
$480,769 weekly rewards for the Badger collateralized vault (bCLAWS/USDC)
With a 3 way split among collaborators that would mean;

48,858 SUSHI (@$8.20/SUSHI) rewards per week for the wbtc/eth SLP collateralized vault (sCLAWS/USDC)

19,543 SUSHI (@$8.20/SUSHI) rewards per week for the bBadger collateralized vault (bCLAWS/USDC)

These weekly rewards would be up to a maximum of 8 weeks.

Sushiswap Benefits

- Large inflow (potentially 100’s of millions) in new liquidity from USDC/CLAWS.
- Attracting new LPs for the WBTC/ETH pool that are looking to borrow against it for CLAWS.
- Potentially large trading volume on the USDC/CLAWS Sushiswap pools.
Competitive advantage due to the exclusive nature of the collaboration and uniqueness of using lp positions as collateral.

Summary :

SushiHOUSE is a fully-customizable treasury management solution built by the Yam Finance team. This proposal would allow the Sushi DAO to migrate part of the sushi treasury into a diversified basket of ETH, BTC, stablecoin and other DeFi allocations as a Bear Market Protection Portfolio. sushiHOUSE will have an active portfolio manager to rebalance portfolio according to risk profiles.

For further divestment in addition to funds allocated to sushiHOUSE a purchase into the Defi Pulse Index (DPI) as a purely buy and hold strategy for the Sushi treasury.

sushiHOUSE Costs
Yam <> Sushi have been mutually supporting each other since their beginnings and we would be happy to support in building sushiHOUSE. We ask in return a 3%+ investment into $YAM token to be hodl’ed inside the sushiHOUSE. Yam Treasury and yamHOUSE currently hodl over $1.5 million in $SUSHI tokens.

Addendum - Purchase $2.5-5m DPI
Summary
Divest the treasury a further $2.5-5m into the Defi Pulse Index (DPI) 1 as a purely buy and hold strategy to diversify the Sushi treasury. This is a separate investment to SushiHOUSE but is being put forward in the same proposal.

Abstract
DPI is a basket of the top DeFi tokens built on Set Protocol V2 contracts. The methodology was designed and is managed by the team at DeFi Pulse aka Pulse inc. Tokens in the index are rebalanced based on relative market cap each month, full details of the methodology including what constitutes an inclusion and how projects are assessed can be found here 1.

The index is now managed jointly between Pulse inc and the community at Index Coop where we look to market, integrate and improve productivity of the index. Part of that role is to communicate the benefits of holding the index compared to the individual tokens and look to share the benefits with both individual and organisational level investors.

During the most recent rebalance, Sushiswap as a project passed 6 months since launch and became eligible for inclusion into DPI. The rebalance has now taken place and the Sushi token makes up just over 8% of the Index 1.

By Feddas

Option 1: total budget of 10M 
5M for sushiHouse + 5M DPI managed by Krugman

Option 2: 2.5M for sushiHouse 2.5M DPI managed by Krugman

Option 3: Create the sushiHouse (up to 5m)

Option 4: Only purchase DPI  (up to 5m)

Option 5: Refusal

The vision for Bonsai is a branch of SushiSwap that extends and focuses on key projects on Solana, and this would initially focus on Solana-native assets such as SOL, SRM, and FIDA for example. As the ecosystem grows, Bonsai would grow alongside it and incorporate additional relevant pools into Sushi’s offering which would otherwise be a challenge for Sushi to include.

1 - SUSHI incentives
We propose a SUSHI incentive structure for Bonsai similar to that of Onsen, which relies on 2,000 allocation points (AP) distributed to each pool relative to the project’s total market cap.

Maki edit: 2000AP is currently not possible without hurting the Onsen and Permanent Menu significantly we can provide up to 300 AP for the Raydium partnership and based on the results upgrade to 500 AP.

However, instead of a tiered system based on market cap, we propose tiers based on Total Value Locked (TVL) for Bonsai. This would mean that APs are allocated based on the pools’ TVL on the Bonsai platform, which then determines the SUSHI incentives distributed to LPs.

Introduction: Sushiswap was recently deployed on Polygon as part of the team’s multi-chain vision. Following that, Polygon ecosystem has seen tremendous growth and adoption with Ethereum L1 dapps like AAVE, Curve, mStable, PoolTogether and many more launching there. To better capitalize on this influx of demand, SushiSwap would benefit by launching SUSHI incentives there on certain pairs, in order to build deep liquidity on Polygon and in turn generating more fees for SUSHI holders. Also it would be in favour of Polygon to maybe match/add to the incentives provided by the SushiSwap team. 

Background: The Polygon ecosystem is a suite of Ethereum scaling solutions with Plasma and PoS chain live and running. SushiSwap is also deployed on the PoS chain but volumes and liquidity are minimal due to absence of any incentives (from both parties). Polygon has DEXes but depth of blue-chip pairs suffers, resulting in price slippage on a $100k transaction. SushiSwap, with its brand image and loyal following should capitalise on this gap. For eg. alloc points can be allocated for the top 5 pairs like ETH-wBTC, ETH-USDC, ETH-MATIC, ETH-DAI and wBTC-USDC. In addition to pairs which community proposes .

Motivation: The purpose of this partnership is to expedite SushiSwap’s multi-chain vision and create new opportunities for Liquidity providers to generate revenue. Going this route, I believe shouldn’t hurt liquidity on L1 Sushiswap primarily due to 2 reasons - 
AAVE recently launched the LM campaign on Polygon and saw TVL soar quickly, but this did not come at a cost to Aave Ethereum mainnet. In fact, they saw an overall 25%+ increase in no. of unique users on Aave. At the time of writing, AAVE had over 6000 active users on Aave Polygon and close to 1.7 B in liquidity (10% of overall market) in less than 3 weeks. 
We know there are two categories of LPs/traders - one are the whales and second the retail. Whales for a multitude of reasons might not move funds over to another chain but the retail will happily cross networks to capture the early APYs/fees. This will generate more transaction volume for SushiSwap and hence more revenue for SUSHI. This where SushiSwap can capture most value by including traders that are priced out on Eth mainnet. Just to give a perspective - 24H transactions on QuickSwap is 232,737 compared to 194,533 on Uniswap. 

Summary: With incentives in place (matched by Polygon), SushiSwap can easily become the premier go to DEX in the Polygon ecosystem which currently holds more than 1B in TVL.

Sushi team was able to lock in 15m$ in incentives from the Polygon foundation to bring more liquidity we need to decide how we will match it?

We have 2 solutions

Leverage some of the sleeping treasury (currently over 200m$)

Use the emissions directly by lowering the incentives of some pairs at the core team discretion.

We were also able to secure 1m$ in incentives from xDai which is another network where we are currently deployed fostering more liquidity and users on these various networks are key in establishing Sushi a go-to DEX on various locations with all the revenues accruing to xSushi holders.

Maki Opinion: This is only the first phase of incentives for cross-chain similarly to Bonsai it is WAY harder to bridge emission and for simplicity/fast execution we should just leverage the treasury this time until we have a proper technical solution in place and with the upcoming oSushi changes we will be able to direct theses emissions at will on various LP pairs - products of Sushi."

To celebrate the launch of Kashi Lending on the BentoBox architecture, I would like to propose a month-long hackathon for products built on top of BentoBox.

To be eligible for prizes, products must be built on top of either solution. A project needs to have an easily accessible, implemented user interface. Potential submissions could be entirely focused on frontend work, like building a page that shows insolvent positions across Kashi or utilizes the power of Kashi’s batch tool and cooks up exciting new recipes.
Products need to interact with Kashi or BentoBox, either on a smart contract or frontend level.

The projects are primarily evaluated on UX, market readiness, innovation, and gas efficiency.

For this hackathon, I am proposing the following prize structure.

prize: 30k USD
prize: 10k USD
prize: 5k USD
All eligible submissions will receive 1k USD in SUSHI.

Special prizes:

25k USD in association with Ampleforth: BentoBox wrapper for AMPL or rebasing tokens. 
5k USD: at the jury’s discretion
5k USD: voted upon by the community
The jury will consist of SushiSwap core team members and selected legends of the DeFi community.

Additionally, I propose to award 30k USD to the first 10 projects that are production-ready on Kashi/Bento.

Crypto art is the soul of the industry, pushing us forward and brightening our days.

The unfortunate reality is that only a few people can live from sales in the form of NFTs as well as the speed of growth in the market making it scary to leave other opportunities behind to focus on crypto art exclusively.

I propose to alleviate these struggles by launching the Sushi Art Class of 2021, giving out 5 scholarships of 50k USDC per annum for ambitious artists to push this part of our community forward.

To be funded are new advances in interweaving crypto and art, personal development, and community outreach.
The funding for a 1 year period shall provide the security artists need to plunge themselves into this exciting world.
SushiSwap has no expectancy for this project except for one piece of work to be presented by the artists as an addition to the Sushi Gallery at the end of the scholarship. The Sushi Gallery will be safeguarded by the SUSHI OPS wallet and displayed in a to-be-determined digital universe.

The jury shall consist of Sushi core team members and angels of the NFT universe."

This proposal’s expectation is to release a maintenance grant. Full details and discussions thus far can be found at: 

https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushi-s-all-in-one-customer-support-and-engagement/4435 

With the increased usage of DEX’s, users are in need of support and troubleshooting. This proposal is designed to create a seamless multilingual customer service portal for Sushi users maintained by community members, aka “Sushi Samurai”. The primary goal is to give users the right customer support experience at every stage of their journey on Sushi. The supplementary goal is to educate the users about the platform at a low-level stage in addition to Gitbooks and give them a visual walkthrough of Sushi and partner ecosystems.

As of now, there are 6 dedicated Samurai who have been extremely helpful with thwarting scam attacks, and assisting users with issues revolving around their DeFi experiences. They 
can be found on the right-hand menu of Discord: 
Maka 
rsk
Porlix
n00bie
HHK
Pegbit

Main Focuses:

- Creating a Core Support team “Sushi Samurais”
- Implement a high-level customer knowledge base covering a wide range of topics on the Sushi ecosystem
- Segregate knowledge base and topics to span across three levels - Beginner, Intermediate, and Pro, allowing the customer flexibility on how they wish to engage with the support system
High-level focus on the visual aspect. Provide users with more visual guidance through the use of illustrations and video walkthroughs included in all major articles.
- Implementing a 3-level support system, with chatbots, live chats, and a ticketing application
- Chatbot to act as a self-serve help service by instantly providing answers to a plethora of frequently answered questions
- Live chat application to provide real-time help from Sushi Samurais.
- The ticketing system allows users to create tickets that can be addressed, handled, and closed out by Sushi Samurais in conjunction with developers.

- Create a direct support line for institutions to bridge to in the future.
“A DeFi 101” coursebook implementation that covers all the important topics in a gamified model for the user to learn from.
Creating community reports and analytics to provide transparency on all the support measures handled in the new platform.

Chef's recommendation : 
All of the Sushi Samurais have been instrumental in helping new & established community members in Discord and will receive my personal guidance if passed with weekly sync to make sure everything is on track.

https://forum.sushi.com/t/kanpai-bear-market-protection-with-treasury-revenue/4310 

Introduce a governance-controlled ‘payout ratio’ parameter (e.g initially set to 95%). This will divert a portion of trading fees (100% - payout ratio) from xSUSHI stakers to the Treasury as revenue denominated in a reserve asset, e.g. ETH or DAI. At a payout ratio of 95%, xSUSHI holders are paid out 95% of the 5bps. Introducing retained earnings will offer valuable bear market protection as well as allow SUSHI holders to govern a new cash flow, which could be used to reinvest in growth or generate non-operating income.

Further voting on parameters would start once this is passed mainly Payout Ratio & Income denomination to officialize them the 95% is indicative only

Chef's Recommendation : 
A great proposal worth reading at length which adds a new flow of assets to the treasury that can be productized down the road to bring more revenues to xSushi holders while making our finance more sustainable and robust in the long term the impact should be minimal while not bringing into circulation more Sushi.

https://forum.sushi.com/t/multichain-expansion-operational-fund/4549 
 
In order to maintain and expand an expansive list of sidechains and layer two solutions, this proposal recommends that 2% from the 5 basis point fee bridged back to SushiBar be reserved under operational management. As a result of community signaling in the linked forum post, the community recommends 2% of the 5 basis point fee and this percentage will be applied to only All Networks except Ethereum Mainnet.

The rationale for this operational fund stems from the need to acquire additional human, infrastructure resources, and align technical objectives. Currently bridging and converting the accumulated LP positions reserved for SushiBar are strategic actions. This operational fund allows for not only the expansion of relevant operational tools to scale these actions, but also ensures bridging is happening often and strategically amongst other ongoing initiatives.

The current model for multichain expansion is quite frankly not sustainable. A mechanism currently does not exist to derive funds from each expansion to sustain subsequent operations. Additionally, it would be a naive assumption that expansion is only a matter of deploying contracts - rigorous infrastructure, monitoring, community building, incentives management all are necessary for successful and sustainable deployments.
The goal of multichain expansion is to grow potential fees for xSUSHI holders. There is no cannibalization of existing yield, rather ensuring each subsequent expansion can be sustainable

Community-Enabled Analytics (CEA) is proposed as a solution to develop a community of nearly 500 individuals that attack analytic challenges in real time for Sushi. The program is designed to drive on-demand data needs - as well as customer acquisition, ecosystem growth and token circulation.

The forum post describes CEO as a free solution with a bounty program to incentivize and reward community members for learning about, analyzing, and publishing blockchain data.

The proposal requests a grant of 1M USD annually in $SUSHI to fund the CEA program for Sushi, which may be renewed on an annual basis.

→ 50% of this will be delivered to ecosystem community members as bounties ($41,667 per month)

→ The other 50% ($41,667 per month) is the subsidization of operational and infrastructure costs.

Year 1 Program Expectations:

Given previous programs, the expected results from a year of bounties would be as follows:

~ A community of 460 educated analysts to produce on-demand insights for Sushi

~ 27,000 $SUSHI retained in ecosystem

~ 350+ unique dashboards, queries, visualizations, & in-depth analyses, plus premium interactive solutions including a Trident concentrated liquidity calculator.

Sushi CEA Program Oversight:

Two components are proposed to provide effective checks and balances to ensure maximum accountability to the Sushi ecosystem:

Oversight Committee: whose purpose is to ensure that the grant proceeds are applied in a manner consistent with its design. The Committee will meet quarterly to review and ensure accountability, and take a vote annually to evaluate the continuation of the program. The Oversight Committee will be composed of 5 members chosen by the SushiSwap community. A Flipside representative will be present at the meetings to provide information and context when/if the committee asks for it, but will not have a vote.

Transparency Dashboard: Results of the program will be broadcast live via a custom dashboard for the Sushi community."

BACKGROUND:

Sushi was the first DeFi protocol on Ethereum to venture out into other blockchains. Now, Sushi supports more than 13 chains (more in the pipeline) and has to do maintenance and add functionalities to all deployments. On many of the chains, Sushi is among the top 3 decentralized exchanges and generates solid revenues. Most often Sushi is considered (rightfully) an Ethereum project and ""local"" DEXs receive more love and support from the chain-native communities.

Supporting many chains is a no-brainer in the multi-chain world we are in today. Sushi is already receiving some support (token incentives) from foundations for deploying to other chains. More importantly though is a connection with the local communities & contributors and onboarding them to the Sushi community.

PROPOSAL:

Fund a team to engage in growth strategy execution with a focus on Marketing and BD with local chain communities & stakeholders to onboard them and get more active contributors and investors.

EXEMPLARY TASKS:

A. 24/7 present in community chats
I. Engage in marketing to onboard new community members from these chains (Onboarding calls, regular AMAs, walkthroughs, ambassador network, share weekly and monthly reporting, etc.) 
D. Run polls, help community solve issues with tools and products
A. Enable new community members to contribute (From joining an ambassador network & simple growth hacking tasks to OS work on integrations and tooling to full-time employment)

NEXT STEPS:

1. Vote on this Temperature Check
2. A Full Proposal with details ($) and room for discussions will be opened in the forum if this first temperature check passes.
3. We & others can propose concrete plans to onboard and integrate users, builders and investors from all chains to the Sushi community.

https://forum.sushi.com/t/samurai-v2-proposal/9549

Synopsis:
Samurai are the community engagement team for Sushi and serve to build trust between users, community members, and Sushi DAO + products.

The primary goal of this proposal is to reinstate the Samurai role which was terminated via the passing of the SMSP-0 Frog Nation proposal. The supplementary goal is to revamp the role of the Samurai to meet the needs of the community after a successful first iteration of the Samurai. Our proposal is based on feedback & learnings from the initial proposal passed on Aug 17, 2021.

TLDR:
This proposal will reinstate the Samurai role and formally define the responsibilities of Sushi’s community engagement team. The Samurai nominated are @pegbit , @maka , @rsk, @Trudahamzik and @Zapacheenie

Going forward, the Samurai will focus on:

1. Customer support: Supporting Sushi users across the entire product suite with 24/7/365 1:1 customer support & scalable product guides & knowledgebase.
2. Community champions: Bring transparency to the inner workings of sushi with Sushi wide reporting & the establishment of an always accessible, always updated data room for key Sushi information.
3. Community engagement: Building tools focused on brand awareness that is not explicitly covered by Marketing, BD, & Brand teams.

The annual cost for the entire Samurai team will be $480,000 plus an annual 20,000 $SUSHI in multisig. This represents less than .04% of Sushi’s market capitalization to ensure Sushi has a dedicated 24/7/365 community engagement team."

*This proposal’s expectation is to produce a community signal. Full details and discussions thus far can be found at:*

https://forum.sushi.com/t/enter-the-stargate-omnichain-strategy/9741

__Synopsis__:
Sushi has been a first mover towards a multi-chain or cross-chain protocol, and is currently deployed across 16 different networks and counting.

It is currently extremely time consuming and a negative experience to swap native chain tokens against non-native ones e.g. BNB → AVAX → ETH

This currently requires multiple steps with various 3rd parties.
 
With that, comes Stargate the first User Application built on top of LayerZero, and is an Omnichain asset transfer protocol that leverages the Delta Δ Algorithm to solve the bridging trilemma.

Stargate has committed to help with resources for Sushi to help make this as light of a lift for the Sushi Team as possible. Stargate will help make this integration happen at no cost to the Sushi Community.

The goal of this proposal is to signal if Sushi should integrate Stargate to facilitate Omnichain native asset swaps and transfers between networks.

__TLDR__:
Implement Stargate Omnichain native asset bridge into Sushi to allow for Omnichain Token Swaps.

**This proposal’s expectation is to produce a community signal. Full details and discussions thus far can be found at:**

https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushi-legal-structure/9720

__Synopsis__:
Sushi is seeking input from the community on the formation of an association or foundation in order to mitigate future risks. This will help us provide legal clarity, limit liability, and create an apparatus to manage administrative issues for Sushi with regards for all token holders and contributors.

Initial estimated budget for the setup is $85k - $100k. With a recurring cost of $10k.

As this is a signal vote, this proposal is designed to indicate a signal for Sushi to progress or not in the direction of forming a Swiss Association. The details of the Association's members and their responsibilities, general legal council, and the types of operational entities that can interact with the Association will be fleshed out before the __Implementation__ vote, should this Signal proposal pass.

__TLDR__:
Continue discussion and work on the implementation of a Swiss structure to guide Sushi’s future."

Synopsis:
Sushi’s Treasury currently has 41,424.01 TOKE ($963,522.47) that could be utilized for staking at a potential APR between 16% - 31%.

The main initiative is to make Sushi’s treasury more productive. The yield earned will help sustain the protocol in the long run. It could be used to help cover fees for setting up the Swiss Association, operations fees etc.

https://forum.sushi.com/t/kanpai-bear-market-protection-with-treasury-revenue/4310

Synopsis:
Introduce a governance-controlled ‘payout ratio’ parameter (initially set to 95% or 90%). This will divert a portion of trading fees (100% - payout ratio) from xSUSHI stakers to the Treasury as revenue denominated in ETH. For example at a payout ratio of 95%, xSUSHI holders are paid out 95% of the 5bps. Introducing retained earnings will offer valuable bear market protection as well as allow SUSHI holders to govern a new cash flow, which could be used to reinvest in growth or generate non-operating income.

Implementation is short and sweet with just a couple of lines of code added to SushiMakerV2 so that a ‘payout ratio’ can be set and diverted to the treasury. Payout ratio will be adjustable, and can go under further governance votes to increase or decrease the percentage taken for the treasury.

This is a 2 part proposal, with 1st part being the vote on executing the Implementation and 2nd part being the vote on the initial ‘payout ratio’ set.

TL;DR
The Treasury’s current near 100% SUSHI allocation could prove to be risky in the event a prolonged bear market occurs, so the Treasury is in need of expanding its ongoing diversification efforts. By diverting a portion of the fees to the Treasury, this would give Sushi enough revenue every year to cover operational expenses and also an ample surplus to invest in low-risk assets to further diversify the Treasury and bring in non-operating income (e.g. by yield farming, providing liquidity on SushiSwap, staking ETH). 

Impact will be minimal to xSushi holders and will not bring more Sushi into circulation."

https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushi-2-0-a-restructure-for-the-road-ahead/10111

**Synopsis:**
This proposal is the first step to a promising & accountable future for Sushi. The proposal is effectively broken down into three actionable items to be voted on. First, retaining the list of team members listed in the forum post. Second, establishment of a formal compensation committee to serve as a check in transparency and accountability for all budgetary matters. Third, the commencement of an executive & leadership search to compliment the team being retained.

The proposal will earmark 6m $SUSHI with a 4 year time horizon to allocate toward:
1. Current contributor allocation
2. Future hire allocation
3. A portion of the funds to fund future project strategy and leadership

The proposal will establish the initial version of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will have the responsibility of compensation negotiations, track TWAP approval for vesting contracts, disclose and work on budget requests.

The proposal will commence a formal leadership & executive talent search. The search will be sourced through the community, team, token, and self nomination. The search will end with an appoint decided via governance vote.

**TLDR:**
1.) Team retainment
2.) Establishing a Compensation Committee
3.) Commencement of a Leadership Search

This proposal's expectation is to produce an implementation. Full details and discussions can be found at: https://forum.sushi.com/t/gauntlet-x-sushi-incentive-optimization-renewal/10507

Synopsis:
This proposal is to renew Gauntlet’s engagement with Sushi on dynamic incentive optimization to drive efficiency and growth for the upcoming 12-month period.

The new engagement seeks to serve Sushi more holistically. The project scope will be expanded to include optimizing the overall incentive budget and expanding optimization efforts across additional chains beyond Ethereum mainnet. The target metric for the engagement is Protocol Utility, defined as revenue less incentives for pools optimized by Gauntlet. 

Gauntlet will provide the core team with a dashboard for visibility and post quarterly updates to the community.

Pricing for the engagement is a $500k service fee (denominated in $SUSHI) and a variable quarterly performance fee of 3.6% of Protocol Utility (denominated in $USDC or $SUSHI).

https://forum.sushi.com/t/klimadao-x-sushi-swap-carbon-offset-integration/10678

Synopsis:

KlimaDAO’s goal is to embed the cost of carbon emissions into our economic system through the creation and governance of a carbon-backed currency, aligning incentives between investors, civil society, and organization. 

KlimaDAO also chose Sushi as the primary place for supplying liquidity for these carbon-based credits making Sushi a critical part of the on-chain carbon market. 

Liquidity was the first step in revolutionizing the current Voluntary Carbon Market. Since then, KlimaDAO has launched tooling that allows anyone to offset their carbon emissions, unlocking the ability for any individual or entity to play a part in the future of the carbon market.

Decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols are the most commonly used application in DeFi and amongst the largest consumers of gas on the blockchain. This makes DEXs a critical point of leverage for combatting carbon emissions on the blockchain.

With this, KlimaDAO is proposing the implementation/creation of an opt-in feature where user’s can elect to and automate the offsetting of their swaps directly through Sushi. Initial signal is to explore adding an optional toggle, like the “expert” mode toggle, that simply enables or disable carbon offsetting for swaps. KlimaDAO is offering to put in the research/development resources in order to produce an implementation for this proposal and will work with the Sushi dev team to make sure the implementation works and is properly integrated.


TLDR:

Give KlimaDAO the wei to build out an opt-in toggle feature to enable Sushi’s user’s to offset their carbon emissions."

Overtime, as members of the multisig took on other responsibilities some have been less available to sign than in the past. Due to this, this proposal is to signal if Sushi should look into replacing 3-4 members of the multisig with new signers that have the availability to sign transactions in a timely manner.

Member rotation will require an additional Implementation vote with more details on who will be joining the Treasury MultiSig and processes for the Treasury members going forward.

TLDR:

Synopsis:

SushiHouse is a Set Token that was setup by Yam’s treasury management team to diversify into assets for bear market protection.

Due to the management team to manage these funds not being in place anymore, this proposal is to determine if Sushi Treasury should redeem the funds that currently makeup the SushiHouse tokens back to the Treasury.

This is a 2-part proposal, with part 1 being the implementation vote on the redemption of SushiHouse funds to the treasury. While part 2 will determine if the funds redeemed should be fully sold for stables or not.

Redemption vote is straightforward and just requires the Treasury multisig to breakdown SushiHouse tokens and redeem funds back to the Treasury.

Sell-off of funds will require Treasury to look into whether OTC or on-chain settlements are the better option for selling off assets, and will go with w/e approach results in smaller amount of slippage from the swaps. Likely being that OTC is the better option for selling out of these tokens.

https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushiguardrouterv01-formal-proposal/10785

Synopsis:

SushiGuardRouterV01 implements MEV protection at the protocol level for Sushi users. Additionally, profits from arbitrage (via back running) will also be collected on chain, and will enable Sushi to generate/capture profits normally realized by arbitrage bots. The profits will be split with Manifold Finance for operating the additional infrastructure and maintenance required to operate it.

Router Upgrade features will include:
+ Gas efficiency, with swaps being cheaper than with current implementation.
+ Back running swaps that will leverage Kashi/Bento (as well as AAVE). Thus, Sushi ecosystem will benefit from these backrun transactions.
+ Back running swaps are done on-chain, and emit an event: Sushi Guard. Allows for easy tracking of router’s profits from back running swaps, which would allow Sushi to do account specific reimbursements.

Estimated Economic Impact:

Preliminary simulations/estimates range from $420k to $1.84m in profits monthly. This is accounting for all chains that the router will be deployed on. (All chains with AAVE deployed). These profits will be split between Sushi and Manifold.

Manifold is willing to help finance the costs of the routing contract. With Sushi supporting a portion of the costs up-front that will include: on-going infrastructure costs, financing part of the router costs, and reimbursement on a portion of the audit costs that have already been completed for the router.

Total costs:

$80k USDC - to pay back Manifold for a portion of the yAcademy audit costs that has already be completed.

$250k split 50-50 sushi/usdc - pays for on-going development/maintenance. The sushi portion also won’t be sold by Manifold, and will be sat on / staked to the bar for at least 3 months and if price goes up Sushi can pocket the difference 50/50.

1. A Cayman Islands foundation (“DAO Foundation”) will be formed to administer the SushiDAO IRL. The DAO Foundation will have a governance council that has the flexibility to administer the Sushi on-chain governance process and facilitate off-chain activities.
    + The DAO Foundation will be able to (among other things):
        + Administer a treasury
        + Administer grants
        + Administer on-chain governance process
        + Facilitate proposals
        + Facilitate voting

2. A Panamanian Foundation (“Panamanian Foundation”) will be formed to administer the existing Sushi protocol (including smart contracts related to the AMM/orderbook, Kashi and staking).
    + The Panamanian Foundation will enter into a services agreement with service providers to assist with developing the protocol.

3. A Panamanian Corporation (“Panamanian Corporation”) will be formed to operate the GUI layer (front-end) of the protocol.
    + The Panamanian Corporation will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Panamanian Foundation.
    + The Panamanian Corporation will enter into a services agreement with service providers to assist with developing and maintaining the GUI layer of the protocol.

+ The DAO Foundation and the Panamanian Foundation and Corporation will enter into service agreements with service providers which will be selected via proposal at a later date.

More information and discussion can be found in the forum post attached to this snapshot.

TLDR:

Steady lads, Sushi Legal Structure is on the wei

https://forum.sushi.com/t/updated-treasury-multisig-signers/11156

Synopsis:

Over the past 2 years of Sushi, there have been various individuals on the multisig. Currently some of the users on the Multisig have become busy with other projects, or no longer have the bandwidth or interest to contribute.

Due to the need to have active signers for the Sushi Treasury, this proposal will determine if we should move forward on the implementation of rotating out members that no longer wish to be a part of the Multisig with a new cohort to oversee and manage the txs needed for the Sushi Treasury.

The following is the new list of signers to sit on the Sushi Treasury:

**Mable Jian** - Growing @Stepnofficial | Host of HODLong 后浪 podcast | Mentor @ @tangent_xyz | ex-@multicoincap | 
https://twitter.com/Mable_Jiang

**0xSami** - Founder of Redacted Carte. Currently on multisigs for several projects including Butterfly, New Order, Olympus, and Aura, and Esketit.
https://twitter.com/0xSami_

**Nick Rishwain** - Building and launching on-chain real estate protocol, operator in legal technology Web2 space. 
https://twitter.com/nickjrishwain

**ChopChop** - Core contributor @NFTX_, member of @dcv_capital
https://twitter.com/0xChop

**Maki** - Previous Head Chef at Sushi. Contributor at LayerZero, Stargate, and Aura. 
https://twitter.com/0xMaki

**Tom Lombardi** - Adjunct professor at Pepperdine University teaching Decentralized Finance. Former Managing Director 3iQ ($700m AUM crypto ETFs) | Former Director at Wave Financial ($1bn AUM crypto treasury management) | Investment banking at BankofAmerica
https://twitter.com/tomlombardi

**DeFiTed** - Founder and lead on ParagonsDAO, prev RULER and COVER (wound down and returned funds to token holders), PleasrDAO founder and founder of the Crypto Safe Space Mental health discord
https://twitter.com/DeFi_Ted

Additionally to the these members being proposed to sit on the Treasury, the following will also be implemented:

- An ongoing list of potential Multisig signers in a queue in a post on the Forum in the event that a current member is inactive or wants to step down.
- Include a review process of 3 months for signers activity and engagement to ensure participation and involvement. 
- Include a process for offboarding signers and onboarding new ones through Multisig review process, and vote from Forum. 
- As there would be too much complexity with managing a USD Price range for tokens, it is proposed to simply do 10,000 USDC steamed via Furo to each of the Multisig signers. In the event of a signer leaving, Furo streams will be canceled and sent back to the Treasury. 
- Sushi Treasury will modify the signing policy to a 4 of 7 

TLDR:

Esskeetit new members and new policies for the Sushi Treasury"

https://forum.sushi.com/t/reinstated-increase-kanpai-treasury-allocation-to-100/11475

Synopsis:

With the introduction of Kanpai and a Treasury Payout Ratio, this proposal is a modification of the previously set payout ratio from 10% to 100% of the Sushi fees to the Treasury. Payout Ratio to the Treasury will stay in place for one year or until new tokenomics are implemented. Revenue to the treasury will be in the form of 50% ETH and 50% USDC, with projection of ~$6m being earned over the next year if this proposal were to pass.

Kanpai is a temporary solution to a long-term problem, and a new tokenomics proposal is on the horizon, which will help address the long-term value proposition of Sushi for it’s community and stakeholders. 

For governance, things will stay the same with xSUSHI still being used as governance voting, and depreciation of xSUSHI will not take place with the passing of this proposal.

Proposal is in the form of a Signal vote, and an implementation vote will follow using the usual Sushi Governance Process.

TLDR:

100% fee redirect to the Treasury for 1-year"

https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushi-vesting-merkle-tree-clawback-temp-check/10008

Synopsis:

During the first 6 months of Sushi's liquidity mining a vest was put in place for 2/3rds of accrued Sushi rewards to be locked up and released after 6 months. With the full release of all vested SUSHI being October 12th, 2021 and thus being well over a year now since the SUSHI was unlocked this proposal will be used to signal the community's decision on clawing back the SUSHI still remaining in the contracts or to not.

Two merkle trees are in place with a collective amount of 8,246,689 SUSHI remaining in the contracts:

https://etherscan.io/address/0x1026cbed7b7e851426b959bc69dcc1bf5876512d

https://etherscan.io/address/0xcbe6b83e77cdc011cc18f6f0df8444e5783ed982

Clawback will go directly to the Treasury, and there will be a plan put forth to set a precedence for the time table and process for clawing back SUSHI in a Implementation proposal if the Signal proposal passes.

Thus further details of the clawback procedure will be worked out depending on the outcome of this proposal, and this is just a Signal to determine if we should go forward with planning this out for Q1 of next year 2023 or not.

TLDR:

To clawback vested SUSHI to the treasury or not"

Synopsis:

Following the temp check in the forum post above, the proposed deadline duration for claiming remaining Sushi from the claw back will be 3 months.

If the proposal passes, then the start date for the final claim will be according to this snapshot end date - January 23rd 13:00 UTC

That results in a final claim date being set to - April 23rd 13:00 UTC

On this date, the two merkle trees will be frozen and an updated merkle root will be set so that clawed back SUSHI can be claimed directly by the Treasury.

TLDR:

3 month deadline to claim SUSHI w/ April 18th being the final day

Sushi clawed back will go to the Treasury"

Following snapshot is for this proposals signal to advance to this implementation vote: 

https://snapshot.org/#/sushigov.eth/proposal/0xd817c716ff271f5141cfe112e1fd7b652f961b4c965852eb44d8ed1ec3a5d3b5

Synopsis:

With the introduction of Kanpai and a Treasury Payout Ratio, this proposal is a modification of the previously set payout ratio from 10% to 100% of the Sushi fees to the Treasury. Payout Ratio to the Treasury will stay in place for one year or until new tokenomics are implemented. 

Premise of the proposal is roughly the same from the signal vote, but with clear guidelines set in place for the timeline of the enacted proposal. The proposal ensures that the 100% ratio of fees to the Treasury will only be in effect for a maximum of one year from when the signal vote passed on Dec 19th 2022. Thus, this means that a hard-stop will be in place for Dec 19th 2023 and the Kanpai payout ratio will revert back to 10% to Treasury and 100% to Sushi Bar. Also, implementation of new tokenomics will also be a cause for a hard stop on the fee re-direct and migrating to the new structure once it’s passed through governance/development and is ready to integrate.

Additionally, a governance dashboard will be developed to give full transparency & insights into the operations budget and the treasury’s assets. 

To summarize the proposal seeks to direct 100% of the revenue earned through fees to the Treasury, with two conditions causing a hard stop:

1. A year has passed with no tokenomics in place (Dec 19th 2023)
2. New tokenomics being implemented 

Revenue to the treasury will be in the form of 50% ETH and 50% USDC, with projection of ~$6m being earned over the next year if this proposal were to pass.

TLDR:

100% fees to the Treasury with a hard-stop in 1 year or when new tokenomics are implemented

Sushi Gov dashboard to follow with full transparency in the DAOs spending and revenue"

https://forum.sushi.com/t/cb-recruitment-jared-grey/11423

Synopsis:

During last fall’s Head Chef Search, CB Recruitment helped Sushi by bringing two candidates to the search process. Ultimately, Jared being one of these candidates and thus now Head Chef of Sushi this proposal will determine if the Sushi DAO should honor the renumeration package that was discussed over forum posts & forum calls to reward CB recruitment for bringing the winning candidate to the race.

CB recruitment in the link forum post, presented 3 options to potentially compensate them for the recruitment effort. The total $$ amount would be $100k, but several options have been laid forth for the renumeration package.

These 3 options include:

1. $50k USDC + $50k SUSHI tokens paid immediately after a successful DAO vote
2. $50k USDC paid immediately + $50k SUSHI tokens (at today’s price) paid 1 year after Jared’s start date (assuming still in position)
3. $50k USDC paid immediately + $50k USDC paid 1 year after Jared’s start date (assuming still in position)

Voting options will consist of the above + a No renumeration package option

TLDR:

CB recruitment helped the DAO find a new Head Chef, what kind of renumeration package (if so) should we honor?"

https://forum.sushi.com/t/legal-entity-update-proposed-changes/12059

Synopsis:

In 2022, the Sushi community mandated that the DAO pursue a legal entity structure to protect business liability. In April of last year, Tangle, a community member, presented the initial governance discussion proposing hiring the law firm Fenwick & West LLP to provide the legal guidance and services to purpose-build the appropriate entity. Throughout the process, it became evident that the model should expand and employ additional steps outside their proposed model. Suggested to the team was further legal advice to help shape the process further with Gresham International. Gresham is a leading international law firm with offices in the UK and UAE. They’ve worked with leading centralized exchange operators and DeFi projects. Gresham advised expanding the entity scope to help establish a more global presence for Sushi, which provides optionality for future business initiatives unavailable in the Fenwick model. Working closely with Gresham, we propose a new model subsidized from the remainder of the budgetary allocation for Fenwick’s work. The result will increase its liability protections for the DAO and contributors.

TLDR:

With Gresham, we’ll maintain business continuity, expand global compliance and liability protections and future-proof the Sushi DAO with a more robust model outside of the scope of Fenwick’s model."

https://forum.sushi.com/t/strategic-cooperation-with-dwf-labs/12047

Synopsis:

DWF Labs a large prop HFT shop and global digital asset market maker is proposing an opportunity to work together to help bolster V3 liquidity, and the trading depth of the SUSHI token.

With DWF, a long term partnership will be formed around increasing the liquidity of V3. Which will include at a minimum, $1.6m of added liquidity to these pairs (pairs may be subject to change):

+ WETH/USDT
+ WETH/USDC
+ LDO/WETH
+ LINK/WETH
+ SUSHI/WETH
+ WBTC/WETH
+ BLUR/WETH
+ MATIC/WETH
+ SNX/WETH
+ COMP/WETH

DWF is also committed to reaching the following market share (DWF Labs trading volume vs SushiV3 trading volume):

+ 3% within 3 months
+ 6% within 6 months
+ 10% within 9 months

Alongside V3 liquidity, DWF Labs is also proposing to support SUSHI on the following exchanges, with market making support with added market depth (±2%):

+ Binance USDT and BUSD pairs: 100k$
+ OKX USDT pair: 75k$

From the Sushi side, DWF Labs is seeking these resources to initiate the partnership:

+ Loan of 2M SUSHI tokens for market making
+ Maturity 24 months
+ DWF Labs pays 5% annualized yield, paid every 4 weeks in USDT to SUSHI Treasury

With a European Call Option (that can be exercised only at the end of the agreement) with the following structure and Strike prices (⅓ of the loan each one):

+ Strike price 1: 125% of a spot price on a day of receiving the loan
+ Strike price 2: 175% of a spot price on a day of receiving the loan
+ Strike price 3: 200% of a spot price on a day of receiving the loan

TLDR:

DWF and Sushi will cooperate together with DWF Labs providing additional V3 liquidity and market making support. A 2m SUSHI loan will be used for the market making w/ a maturity of 24 months - 5% annualized yield, paid every 4 weeks in USDT to Sushi Treasury. A call option will be used for the incentive for DWF Labs w/ a strike price for increased SUSHI spot price that follows: 125%, 175%, 200%."

Full details and discussions thus far can be found at: https://forum.sushi.com/t/rfc-deploy-new-tokenomics-for-sushi/12513/1

Synopsis:
Restructuring Sushi’s token model will help cement its role in the protocol’s ongoing success and contribute to its growth. Since its launch, Sushi has been at the forefront of tokenomics with initiatives like MasterChef and xSushi. We aim to present a token model that sets us on a sustainable growth path and long-term strategy. In January, we published an initial draft, which, thankfully, generated meaningful feedback from the Sushi and DeFi community, and we believe this final draft represents the best model curated from that feedback.

As Kanpai expires in December of this year and Sushi’s current distribution model quickly approaches full distribution, our new proposal outlines our vision for a revised Sushi token model crafted to ensure stability and sustained value for all stakeholders. The model builds on three pillars: protocol sustainability, token utility enhancement, and treasury diversification. We invite you to review the proposed changes showcased in our paper, which will synergize to support a resilient token economy.

Below is a brief overview of the new model’s mechanics and goals.

Challenges and Solutions
We’ve identified several challenges through thorough analysis.
Here’s a brief on what we’ve found and our proposed solutions:
We aim to improve rewards efficiency, reducing the annual cost of Sushi emissions.
Establish a balanced approach to its emissions distribution. 
Currently, the emissions-to-Sushi-Bar income suggests a 1:1 ratio.
Financial Stability: Address the current emissions-to-income ratio.
LP Incentives: Sushi LP incentives need recalibrating to remain competitive.
Staking Mechanisms: Revise xSushi staking to serve high-conviction participants better.
xSushi Distribution: Align xSushi staking to provide fairer distribution among participants.

Economic Model
Our economic model scales strategically via innovation, such as:
Trading Fees: A primary revenue source from LP transactions
Routing Fees: Income from trade fees via aggregation
Staking Fees: Potential revenue from staking rewards
Partnerships: Strategic partnerships

Stakeholder Considerations
Align our tokenomics with the interests of our key stakeholders:
Liquidity Providers (LPs): Aimed at ensuring long-term incentives.
xSushi: Stable supply, non-dilutive rewards, and governance.
Traders: Offer an improved trading experience with low slippage.
Token Projects, DAOs: Building long-term partnerships.
Sushi Treasury: Ensure diversified and sustainable income.

Goals for a Redesigned Token Model
The revised proposal has several objectives:
Promote decentralized ownership.
Amplify liquidity.
Encourage sustainable growth.
Enhance the protocol’s sustainability.
Bolster $SUSHI utility.
Diversify the treasury for robust financial operations.

Our model aims to enhance liquidity, offer non-dilutive token rewards, institute a balanced supply, and ensure competitiveness.

TL;DR:
Voting for this snapshot will accomplish the following:
Begin the work to enact the proposed framework in the paper.
Reshape Sushi’s token model to promote its ecosystem goals.
Increase decentralized ownership via the DAO.
Optimally realign stakeholders where the current model is limited.
Promote ecosystem growth with sustainable emissions and value."

Candidate Name: Kevin Michael Kozeny

https://forum.sushi.com/discussion/23761-apply-to-become-a-sushi-high-kitchen-member?comment=87473

Motivation and Interest:

As a seasoned angel investor in the crypto and tech sectors, I have a well rounded understanding of blockchain technology, gaming, decentralized finance, and the evolving landscape of digital assets. My experience enables me to identify innovative opportunities and potential challenges. My years of service in the United States Navy have instilled in me a strong sense of duty, integrity, and leadership. I am adept at making critical decisions under pressure, maintaining transparency, and upholding ethical standards, all of which are essential qualities for a SushiSwap High Kitchen Member. I have been invested in Sushi token since early days, and would love to support the ecosystem as a High Kitchen Member. I am prepared to serve as a supportive High Kitchen Member and operate the MultiSIg in accordance with the scope of this proposal. 

Understanding and Commitment to Decentralized Governance:
 I believe in the SushiDAO ecosystem, and am eager to support the DAO by being trustworthy and dependable. In the past I have been active in the ApeCoin DAO, and I am extremely familiar with the nature of governance and the technologies that we will be required to use as Multi-Sig signers. Through my years of service in the United States Navy, I have been responsible for high-integrity decision-making and strategy in various different roles. I bring integrity, work ethic, and execution to the table for the DAO. I have always been drawn to innovative technologies that challenge the status quo. I am extremely motivated by the chance to support and nurture this cutting-edge ecosystem. I have been invested in the Sushi token since the early days, and would love to have an opportunity to support the ecosystem as a trusted participant in the High Kitchen. 

Governance and DAO Participation:

Throughout the past 15 years I have seen adversity and I have met it with grit, hard work, and a no excuse mentality. The military has in instilled in me an attention to detail that cannot be replicated. A work ethic that is not only honest and hard, but also an overarching awareness for executing tasks in a very timely fashion. Proposals, grants, ideas, and everything that comes across our table must be honed in on as a High Kitchen Member. As a former member of the United States Navy, I have been responsible for following complex directives and frameworks. As a High Kitchen Member, I am committed to honoring governance votes, and carrying out the role that is laid out for High Kitchen members. 
Translatable Skills and Experience:
My experience lends itself directly to the DAO, in the sense that I can contribute to the development and support of systems, and execute in accordance with this proposals ethos. Having extensive experience in DIfi, using wallets, and decentralized applications will allow me to perform all necessary functions as a High Kitchen Member. My unique combination of investment expertise, military leadership, commitment to transparency, and proactive engagement makes me an ideal candidate to be a High Kitchen Member. I am eager to bring my skills, values, and dedication to the DAO. To foster a thriving, innovative, and inclusive community.

Time Commitment:

Very willing to dedicate 5-10 hours per month

Conflict of interest:

I have zero conflict of interest

TLDR:
A positive and sufficient outcome in this vote will result in the candidate above being appointed to the Sushi High Kitchen, thereby clearing the way for the candidate to be placed on the treasury multi-sig."

Motivation and Interest:

I have been invested in crypto for a while and have had deep respect for Sushi as a leader in DeFi and DEX technology. As a leader in the space, it has introduced groundbreaking innovations like the accrual of tokens for the community through exchange fees. Community alignment is crucial, and SushiSwap empowers its users to shape the protocol’s future. As the founder of a DAO administration infrastructure startup, I am deeply interested and committed to upholding and supporting decentralized governance processes. I hope to learn more about the DeFi ecosystem, and ensure the Sushi governance processes are respected and upheld through my role as a signer. 
I am committed to fostering this alignment by being a timely and active signer. I will stay current with developments, review decisions, and ensure that governance votes reflect the spirit of Sushi’s decentralized governance framework.

Understanding and Commitment to Decentralized Governance:

As I mentioned, my background as of late is currently working as the founder of a DAO admin infrastructure business. My role is to honor and support the infrastructure of decentralized governance for protocols and DAOs and ensure that the utmost standard of decentralized governance is maintained. I have a deep understanding of how Snapshot, the forum process works, managing decentralized wallets and signing transactions, and all of the core functions needed to be a trusted member of the High Kitchen. 

Governance and DAO Participation:

In my past roles in Fintech/Enterprise SaaS, as a member of the Columbia tennis team, as a student, and now in my latest startup venture, it has been incumbent on me to act with the utmost integrity and focus on doing the job in front of me to the best of my ability. As a multi-sig signer I understand my role as someone who is meant to carry out the wishes of the DAO, through the existing governance framework. I am committed to honoring the governance votes and DAO decisions, and respecting the framework that is put in place. I deeply believe this framework is one that will serve Sushi long-term, and I hope to aid as a trusted member of the council in that fashion. 

Relevant Experience and Skills:

In my background working in Fintech, I was responsible for gathering the necessary documentation from clients and collaborating closely with financial underwriters to structure deals that were financially beneficial for both parties. This process involved securing multiple approvals and signatures from all stakeholders to ensure mutual agreement and compliance.  Furthermore, my experience playing Division 1 tennis for Columbia University instilled in me a strong sense of accountability and a commitment to prioritizing the best interests of the organization as a whole. As mentioned above, I have the relevant experience as a signer and decentralized wallet user to fulfill the needs and requirements laid out in this role. 

Time Commitment:

Yes, I can dedicate 5-10 hours per month to provide dedicated attention to these responsibilities.

Conflict of interest:

N/A

TLDR:

A positive and sufficient outcome in this vote will result in the candidate above being appointed to the Sushi High Kitchen, thereby clearing the way for the candidate to be placed on the treasury multi-sig."

https://forum.sushi.com/discussion/23761-apply-to-become-a-sushi-high-kitchen-member?comment=87411 

Motivation and Interest:

I’ve always been interested in SushiSwap because it stands out as an original DEX. Especially noteworthy is how SushiSwap was one of the first to distribute fee revenue to Sushi token holders, truly embodying the values of decentralization and democratization in the crypto space. This has made a significant contribution to the ecosystem. While many DAOs are becoming more like proprietary foundations, SushiSwap maintains its commitment to DAO values, which is why I’ve always wanted to be part of the Sushi ecosystem.

Additionally, I’ve come to understand firsthand how challenging it is to run a democratic and decentralized DAO. I’m the Vice-Champion of Bankless Korea DAO and also founded and currently run the Bankless Korea Investment DAO, a SubDAO. I believe that for a DAO to be truly decentralized and democratic, it must be closely integrated with the DeFi ecosystem, and its operational system must support this. By participating as a member of SushiSwap’s High Kitchen, which is a model of exemplary governance, I aim to apply SushiSwap’s values to the operation of DAOs in the Asian region.

Understanding and Commitment to Decentralized Governance:

As the Vice-Champion of Bankless Korea DAO, I am actively involved in producing web3 content. I also founded the Bankless Investment DAO, a SubDAO, where I lead collaborative research and joint investments with the members. In my role as the Founder and Champion of the Investment DAO, I act as a General Partner (GP). Throughout this journey, I’ve implemented and used various DAO tools that support decentralized governance. For wallet management, we utilize Gnosis Safe’s multi-sig. Additionally, I contribute web3-related research and articles to web3 media and research platforms in South Korea.

Governance and DAO Participation:

+ Investment Research & Portfolio Management:
As the Founder and GP of Bankless Investment DAO, I lead investment research and have established a portfolio management system. Additionally, I have experience as a Gold member of the Global Coin Research (GCR) DAO, where I participated in early investment deal calls. While Bankless Investment DAO is still developing its investment system, the insights gained can be shared with Sushi governance.

+ Communication:
I believe communication is crucial in a DAO. Through various DAO activities, I have honed my communication skills to align with DAO culture. I will actively and faithfully participate in the Sushi ecosystem, contributing to its development through proactive communication. Grant Reviewer Experience: Recently, I served as a tier2 reviewer for Arbitrum’s ThankARB grant program. This role enhanced my understanding of grant programs and sharpened my ability to identify valuable projects for the DAO. As a High Kitchen Member, I will understand the DAO’s vision and goals and allocate funds accordingly.

+ Content Creator in the Korean Market:
At Bankless Korea, I create various web3 content. I’ve noticed SushiSwap’s recognition is not very high in Asia and Korea. I aim to contribute to the DAO by producing content targeting the Korean market. Particularly, at Bankless Investment DAO, we are educating Korean retail investors, who are accustomed to CEX, about healthy DeFi investments. I believe SushiSwap is the ideal project to introduce to the Korean public and hope we can create synergy together.

+ Asian Market Network:
Additionally, Bankless Korea is in partnership with Bankless Japan. We plan to strengthen our collaboration with Bankless East Asian nodes in the future. I also have a diverse web3 network within Korea. I am committed to providing practical support for SushiSwap’s expansion into the Asian market.

Time Commitment:

I can commit to dedicating 5-10 hours per month.

Conflict of interest:

Just to clarify, this isn’t a conflict of interest, but Bankless Korea DAO operates independently from Bankless HQ and Bankless International DAO. Recently, Bankless and the DAO have completely separated. Bankless Korea also functions entirely independently and has no conflicting interests.

TLDR:
A positive and sufficient outcome in this vote will result in the candidate above being appointed to the Sushi High Kitchen, thereby clearing the way for the candidate to be placed on the treasury multi-sig."

Time Commitment:

5-10 hours per month is fine

Conflict of interest:

Additional information:

Hypotenuse Labs operates independently, without external investors or dependencies. Our self-sufficiency requires careful financial management, which we believe will contribute positively to the Sushi ecosystem’s stability and growth.

Candidate Name: Adarsh Bhatt 

https://forum.sushi.com/discussion/23761-apply-to-become-a-sushi-high-kitchen-member?comment=87133 

Motivation and Interest:

I am passionate about becoming a SushiSwap High Kitchen Member because I firmly believe in the transformative potential of decentralized finance broadly and admire SushiSwap’s innovative approach in the DeFi space specifically, as one of the first movers in the category. My journey as an early-stage investor in the web3 ecosystem I share much excitedment as to how decentralized protocols can revolutionize traditional financial systems.

SushiSwap was actually one of my first introductions into the DeFi space and pushed me to learn more. Over the years, I have closely collaborated with one of the Sushi Labs members, gaining deep insights into the vision and long-term goals of SushiSwap. This relationship has fueled my excitement about SushiSwap’s mission and upon learning about thHigh Kitchen, it was a no-brainer for me to apply and potentially become a direct contributor in its journey.

Joining the High Kitchen would be a meaningful opportunity for me to actively participate in shaping the future of SushiSwap and contribute to the broader DeFi movement. I am committed to dedicating my time, skills, and passion to help SushiSwap thrive and continue its mission of decentralizing finance.


Understanding and Commitment to Decentralized Governance:

Although I haven’t been actively involved in other DAOs, my role as an early-stage investor has provided me with a deep understanding of DAOs. Through my work, I have assessed numerous web3 projects alongside traditional software ventures, which has given me valuable insights into the principles and practices of decentralized governance.

Some key concepts related to decentralized governance that I am familiar with include:
+ Proposal Mechanisms: Understanding how proposals are created, discussed, and voted upon within the community to drive protocol changes and improvements.
+ Voting Systems: Familiarity with various voting mechanisms, such as token-weighted voting, quadratic voting, and other consensus methods used to capture the community’s preferences and make decisions.
+ Multi-Sig Wallets: Knowledge of the security and operational aspects of multi-signature wallets, which require multiple approvals for transactions, ensuring a higher level of security and collective control over funds.
+ Tokenomics: Insight into how token economics can be designed to incentivize participation, align stakeholder interests, and ensure the sustainable development of a protocol.


Governance and DAO Participation:

To ensure my commitment to following governance votes and DAO decisions, I adopt a structured and disciplined approach that involves staying informed, engaging actively with the community, and prioritizing transparency and accountability. Here are some things that I plan to commit to in being a High Kitchen member:

+ Staying Informed and Engaged:
Regular Monitoring: I will allocate dedicated time each month to review governance forums, proposal discussions, and voting results. This helps me stay updated on the latest developments and upcoming votes within the DAO.
Community Participation: I will engage in community discussions through forums, Discord, and other communication channels allowing me to understand the perspectives and concerns of different stakeholders. This will help me make informed decisions that align with the community’s / other relevant stakeholders’ interests.

+ Transparency and Accountability:
Public Commitment: I believe in making my voting decisions and rationales public to the community. By explaining the reasoning behind my votes, I aim to foster transparency and hold myself accountable to the community.

+ Structured Decision-Making:
Research-first Approach: Before casting a vote, I plan to properly analyze the proposal, considering its potential impact on the protocol, stakeholders, and the broader ecosystem. This involves reviewing technical details, economic implications, and community feedback.

+ Examples of Commitment/Community:
Active Participation in Investment Decisions: As a partner at Comma Capital, I have been actively involved in making investment decisions based on thorough analysis and consensus among our investment committee. This experience translates well to following governance votes, as it requires a similar level of diligence and collaboration.

Supporting Community-Driven Projects: I have supported several community-driven projects in the traditional and web3 space by providing feedback, participating in governance discussions, and helping with strategic planning. Furthermore, I have as part of Comma created a community of over 800+ operators across the web2 and web3 ecosystems and know first-hand what it takes to build, take feedback from, and iterate optimally for a community-inspired organization.

By implementing these strategies and leveraging past experience, I am committed to following governance votes and DAO decisions with integrity and dedication. My experience in evaluating early-stage projects and my active engagement in and building community equip me with the skills necessary to contribute effectively to SushiSwap’s decentralized governance.

A. Investment Strategy and Portfolio Management:
Early-Stage Investments: As a partner at Comma Capital, I have led investments in numerous early-stage companies, including those in the blockchain and DeFi space. This experience has honed my ability to evaluate financial risks, perform due diligence, and make strategic investment decisions.

B. Treasury Operations:
Fund Management: I have managed multiple funds, ensuring proper allocation, compliance, and reporting. This includes overseeing financial transactions, maintaining liquidity, and optimizing returns.

D. Other Relevant Qualifications:

Community Leadership: As mentioned earlier, I run a community of over 800 operators at tech companies, a portion of whom are involved in web3. This community provides a rich source of insights, collaboration opportunities, and strategic partnerships.

Industry Connections: Leveraging my extensive network within the blockchain and venture capital ecosystems, I can facilitate strategic partnerships and collaborations that might benefit the SushiSwap protocol and its treasury management. Additionally, I have co-invested with web3 funds such as a16z, Paradigm, and Dragonfly, further expanding access to resources within the industry.

Time Commitment:

Yes, confirmed i can commit 5 - 10 hours per month.
